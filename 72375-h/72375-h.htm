<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> following essay, which was awarded
the Le Bas Prize for 1923, is an attempt to
find some relation between historical novels on
the one hand and history treated as a study on
the other; and, further, to work out a method
of critical approach. It does not defend historical
fiction against the historian; it welcomes
this form of art from his point of view, finding
its justification in the character of history
itself. It seeks to estimate the novel as a work
of resurrection, a form of “history,” a way of
treating the past. In this it does not pretend to
be exhaustive, but puts forward one aspect of
the problem and attempts to track down the
peculiar virtue of fiction as the gateway to the
past.</p>

<p>These words call us to the window that opens
out upon the past, and they set the mind thinking
in pictures; for the mind of every one of us holds
a jumble of pictures and stories, shot through,
perhaps with sentiment, that constitute what we
have built up for ourselves of the Past, and are
always ready to be called into play by a glimpse
of some old ruin that awakens fine associations,
or by a hint of the romantic, such as Wordsworth
gives in those lines. A cathedral bell, or the
mention of Agincourt, or the very spelling of
the word “ycleped” may be enough to send the
mind wandering into its own picture-galleries
of history, just as the words “Once upon a
time—” waft us into the realms of fairy-story;
these things are symbols, keys that unlock a
world in our minds. Let a Pre-Raphaelite
picture remind us of lost fashions or a schoolboy
sing “John Peel” and we are bridging the
centuries; and only a few key-words are needed
to give the mind a clue, and we are with the
Elizabethans on the Spanish Main, or with
King Harold, defending the gate of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>A hundred things have helped to build up
this picture-gallery of history—not merely
history-books, but Bible-stories, and local traditions
and stories from opera; not merely
biographies but the border-ballads that the old
gipsies would sing amid grim surroundings, and
the rant of politicians who talk of Magna Carta
or Nelson, and the picturesque advertisements
of magazines and street-posters; out of all these
there has grown up a world in our minds and
that world is what we make for ourselves of the
past. We may try to modify and correct it by
our conscious studies, but we cannot escape it.
And not the least of the sources of it is the
Historical Novel.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott did not write historical novels
because he wished to teach history in an easy
way or to get at a moral indirectly, but because
his mind was full of the past, just as the mind
of a musician is full of tunes; he made for himself
a world out of the past, and lived in it much;
and he painted that world for his readers, and
turned it into a tale. Whatever connection the
historical novel may have with the history that
men write and build up out of their conscious
studies, or with History, the past as it really
happened, the thing that is the object of study
and research, it certainly has something to do
with that world, that mental picture which each
of us makes of the past; it helps our imagination
to build up its idea of the past. After all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
history we have ever learned our first thought
of Mediaeval England is quite likely to be a
picture of England as the setting for Ivanhoe
and Robin Hood, even if our second thought
is that this is all wrong; and though we may not
seek to gather our historical facts from the novel,
there are more subtle things, unconscious prejudices
and unformulated sentiments that we
take in unawares, there are pictures that haunt
us, there is an atmosphere that compels us, and
if we find nothing else we find the sentiment of
history, the feeling for the past, in the historical
novel. On one side, therefore, the historical
novel is a “form” of history. It is a way of
treating the past.</p>

<p>In this it is linked up with legend, and the
traditions of localities, and popular ballads; like
these it goes beyond the authenticated data of
history-books, the definitely recoverable things
of the past, in order to paint its picture and tell
its story; and like these it often subordinates
fidelity to the recovered facts of history, and
strict accuracy of detail, to some other kind of
effectiveness. And these legends and popular
stories are related to the historical novel in a
way similar to that in which a snatch of folk-song
is related to the music of a cultured genius, or
an anecdote or a piece of gossip is related to some
work of structure as well as of fiction, like the
novel. The one is a work of apparently popular,
or at least anonymous origin, the other is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
deliberately artistic and organised production.
When we hear those legends we feel that it is
Earth itself that throws them out; it is this old
World of ours telling a tale that she seems to
remember. These things ask to be believed; a
local tradition claims to be true, or it has no
currency; but the historical novel is conscious
in its purpose and in its inventions. We do not
say that we enjoy it “although” it is not quite
true to facts; the element of fiction in it is avowed,
and is part of the intention of the work; for the
historical novel is a “form” of fiction as well
as of history. It is a tale, a piece of invention;
only, it claims to be true to the life of the past.</p>

<p>And so there is a double set of relations to
be considered in any study of the subject, arising
out of the double character of the subject. On
one side the historical novel may be regarded
simply as a novel with a particular kind of
background; a story set, say, in the Middle
Ages, just as a novel of modern times might find
its setting in some far country. But if this were
the whole truth of the matter there would be no
point in giving it a special study. A fairy-tale
is not merely an ordinary kind of story set in
fairy-land, but becomes a different kind of story
by being placed there; in the same way, although
in a sense every novel tends to become
in time a historical novel, and there will come a
day when “Sonia” will be useful to the historian
for a certain kind of information, yet a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
true “historical novel” is one that is historical
in its intention and not simply by accident, one
that comes from a mind steeped in the past.
Such a novel will have a special kind of appeal.</p>

<p>When a composer picks up a piece of poetry
and puts it to music he weaves a web of invention
around the words and amplifies them with something
that belongs to an art different from their
own; in doing so he will probably alter the
swing of the poem and create rhythms of his
own, and in the music that he makes the original
music of the words themselves will almost
certainly be destroyed; even when he is trying
to interpret the poem he may be changing its
very character, making a breezy thing desolate,
or converting a majestic hymn into a joyful
anthem, and, unawares, he may be doing everything
that would send the poet crazy, and make
men of letters indignant. The final result may
not be good as poetry, may indeed be a good piece
of poetry spoilt in the very things that make it
good, the character of the original words having
been altered in a hundred subtle ways. Standing
alone it may not even be a good piece of music
exactly. But it may be what it sets out to be—a
good piece of work in a form neither poetry
nor music, but a combination of the two, a new
creation, something with an appeal of its own.
That is to say, it may be a good piece of song,
that justifies itself when it comes from the voice
of the singer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<p>Like an opera, in which music and poetry and
drama melt into one another to produce what
amounts to a new kind of art, with a purpose and
an idiom of its own; like a song, in which music
and poetry are interlocked, and become one
harmony, the historical novel is a fusion. It is
one of the arts that are born of the marriage of
different arts. A historical event is “put to
fiction” as a poem is put to music; it is turned
into story as words are turned into song; it is
put into a context of narrative which is like the
result that is obtained when words are printed
between the staves of a vocal score. And just
as a composer in choosing a poem to set to music,
accepts certain limitations, volunteers a certain
allegiance, and must in some way be loyal to
the poetry he has selected, so the historical
novelist owes a certain loyalty to the history of
which he treats. But because this is a marriage
of the arts it is not a complete loyalty, and just
as poets complain because musicians modify
the original rhythms of their poems and the lilt
of the words, so historians cry out because a
Scott tampers with history. For all arts that
combine different forms of art are beset with
divided loyalties like these, and with causes of
disagreement and annoyance. The very appeal
that they should make is a thing to be discovered,
a matter of controversy. And in the study of
them, every issue is a complicated one.</p>

<p>And, lastly, it may be said that a given song<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
may be good poetry if read in an armchair; the
music of a song may be good in itself if played
over on some instrument; and yet the song may
be a poor thing when sung by anybody, if the
two do not hang together, if the marriage is not
a harmony. In the same way, a historical novel
may be a good book but not a good historical
novel. It may be a just piece of history; or it
may be a good story; but it may not be good with
the special goodness of a historical novel, it
may not combine its two elements in just the
way that is needed. It is not exactly that history
and fiction should dovetail into one another to
produce a coherent whole; it is not simply that
the story of the Popish Plot can be rounded off
by a piece of invention, or the tragedy of Mary
Queen of Scots depicted more fully and with
more connectedness by the interspersion of
imaginary episodes; but it is rather that in the
historical novel history and fiction can enrich
and amplify one another, and interpenetrate.
They can grow into one another, each making
the other more powerful. And they can make
a special kind of appeal to the reader.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The facts of the past, the stuff out of which
men write their Histories, are used for many
things besides the manufacture of history. The
economist, the politician, the musician, the
ecclesiastic—in fact, specialists of all sorts, have
their own use for the facts that make up history;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
they make themselves more expert in their
special departments by studying the historical
side of those departments, but they are not
historians any more than is the architect who
tries to make himself a better architect by finding
out how houses used to be ventilated. The
theorist makes his generalisations out of the
facts of the past, and talks about the laws that
govern the movements of history and the things
that determine progress and the goal to which
human development is moving—but he is not
a historian any more than the priest talking about
Providence is a historian, although both these
deal with interpretations of history. They are
simply philosophers trying to interpret man’s
experience of life to man. The Historian’s
interest in the past is not the economist’s or the
philosopher’s interest in it, he loves the past
for its own sake and tries to live in it, tries to
live over again the lost life of yesterday, turning
it back as one would turn back the pages of a
book to re-read what has gone before; and he
seeks to see the past as a far-country and to
think himself into a different world. And so the
use that he makes of the accumulated facts that
tell about the past, is to recapture a bygone age
and turn it into something that is at once a
picture and a story.</p>

<p>History, then, means the world looking back
upon itself, and storing up memories that are
pictures. History is any tale that the old world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
can tell when it starts remembering. It is just
the world’s Memory.</p>

<p>The love of the past for its own sake, and the
fondness for lingering over those things that
endure as relics or as symbols of the past, and the
regret for the things that are lost for ever are
what one might call romanticism. Gibbon and
Gregorovius had this feeling when the sight of
the splendid ruins and remains of Rome drove
them, each in turn, to look into the story that
lay behind monument and masonry, and to
be writers of history. All of us have this feeling
when the glimpse of some historic town, or the
impressive sternness of an old castle, or the
sight of a Roman wall, awakens a world in our
minds, and sets us thinking on all the tales that
stone could tell if only it could speak the history
that it stores. These buildings and remains are
the maimed survivals, the broken emblems, of
a vivid thrilling life that has been lived, and
that we love to look back upon. Distance lends
enchantment, and the things of long-ago draw
us with their strangeness, and with a far-away,
picturesque glamour that surrounds them; and
there is just the escape that we seek from modern
life, in the possibility that we have of thinking
ourselves into a different world, which we can
suffuse with a romantic glow and which we can
think of as having more colour and adventure
than our own world. But, most of all, the reason
why we love the ruins of an abbey, and preserve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the flags that are riddled with the bullets of
Waterloo—the reason why we prize the book in
the margins of which Coleridge himself scribbled
pencil-notes of literary criticism, and keep a
lock of Keats’s hair, is that these things are like
the stray flowers that cheat the scythe or like
the last stars that outdare the morning sun; they
are the few things that are saved from a shipwreck.
The work of a historian is to reconstruct
the past out of the debris that is cast up by the
sea from the wrecks of countless ages.</p>

<p>Romanticism is at bottom a sigh for the things
that perish, and the things that can never happen
again. It is like the soldier going over the hill
to fight, but always looking back and lingering.
The things that Time destroys we love with a
love fed by romantic regret—the sunset that
will never just happen again, the snows of
yester-year, the beliefs that are being sapped,
the days of our own childhood. In <cite>The Cloister
and the Hearth</cite>, Gerard at the beginning of his
wanderings is kindly treated by a woman and
her husband; as he leaves them they wish him
“God speed,” and, says the author, “with that
they parted, and never met again in this world”;
and nobody can read that sentence without
loving these people more. If some novelists
had described this incident, if, say Dickens had
been writing this, it would have been part of
his way of working, it would have been in
keeping with his avowed theories of life, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
renew the connection between Gerard and his
kind acquaintances later in life, and by some
coincidence to make the good woman and her
husband turn up when we had forgotten their
existence. But Reade not only declines to do
this, he goes out of his way, beforehand, to tell
us that he is not going to do this; he makes these
people pass out into the darkness and so he
leaves us with a feeling of affectionate regret for
them. When we know a thing must die, something
comes to reinforce our love for it, and if
we were all told to take our last look upon this
earth to-morrow, what worst of world-haters
would not ask again and again for “just one
peep more”? Universal literature is full of
regrets for all the lovely things that die. All
history is full of movements that are born of
romantic reactions—of prophets stoned on one
day and mourned the next, of rejected leaders
idolised when they have passed off the stage and
soon carried to power again by a mad romantic
impulse that moves the people, of kings beheaded
and then loved when they have become
a memory, of Restorations, of returns from Elba,
and of Jacobite risings. Every generation cries
that the world is going to the dogs and that
things are not as they have been, and two years
before the Spanish Armada was routed an
Englishman could complain that English courage
was on the wane. All this is romanticism; and
it is romanticism that makes old men gather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
round a chimney-corner to tell a tale of old times,
and makes hardened heroes love to fight their
battles over again. It is this feeling that sends
us treading again the haunts of childhood and
recapturing childhood scenes; that makes our
imagination play around historic sites and
ancient buildings, peopling them with a life
that we have invented, and awaking them to their
former activeness; and that so thrills the heart
with a sense of the great bygone things, that
some men cannot see the sun go down red without
dreaming of battles long ago, till the moors
become alive with excited horsemen and with
noises that the hills turn into echoes, and the
past seems to unearth itself.</p>

<p>It is possible to imagine a political theorist
visiting Brazil to make a study of political conditions
there; or to think of a student of public
health going to Edinburgh to gain a knowledge
of its drainage system; but apart from these
specialists there is the traveller who will describe
Brazil to men as a strange country, and there is
the Stevenson who will give a sketch of Edinburgh
for the general reader; and the historian
is like these. He travels the past in a caravan;
he dips into it as one would dip into Edinburgh,
peeping into the shadowy slums and crooked
streets, and hunting the eternal human things.
He describes the past not because it has connections
with the present that can be worked
out, not because it holds a moral for to-day, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
precisely because it is a strange land, precisely
because it is past, and can never happen again;
and he seeks to paint life as a whole—not man
on his economic side, or man as a political
animal, but man in all his adventures in living.
Specialists and theorists may tread at his heels
to draw a moral or to make generalisations, but
as for the romantic historian, his is the mad
human longing to see and to know people,
to feel with them, and to peep at the world
they lived in, and to understand their ways,
their humours, their loves and fears. As he
looks to the deserted ruins of a hillside farm he
wonders what sentiments filled the hearts of
men and women there when Jacobite rebels rode
past on their dismal return Northwards; when
he sees the old mill, where the tossing hill-streams
meet and the twisted roads come to a
ford, he wonders what difference it made to the
children playing at the water’s edge, when
Cromwell and his troopers passed that way; and
when he stands in the shadow of what was once
a frowning wall, he asks himself all the things
that the wall must have overheard and overlooked,
and all the tales of joy and adventure, of
trouble and of treachery, that it might tell if it
were not doomed to keep them to itself. And
once the romanticist has stared at this programme
of his, and has confessed his faith and
has faced himself with this thing that he is
really seeking—once he has understood his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
heart’s longing, then there must flash upon him
the tremendous truth—the impossibility of
history.</p>

<p>To the politician, the important movements
and striking decisions and big crises that for
him are “history,” are things within reach; the
military man has not much difficulty in recovering
the noisy things that for him are
“history”; the diplomatist knows where to look
for the story of international tangles, and the
mysteries of pacts and treaties and the hidden
sources of power in a state; court and camp and
parliament house are rich with documents and
records; the things that are played out in the
limelight, the stately public events are, in a
way, simple to the historian, and the men who
talk of democracies and regiments and alliances,
and who think of people in the mass and can
find food in statistics and budgets—these can
discuss the condition of England and the welfare
of the people. But they are far from life. Now
the “huts where poor men lie” elude the world’s
Memory. The ploughman whom Gray saw,
plodding his weary way, the rank and file of
Monmouth’s rebel crowd—every man of them
a world in himself, a mystery of personality,
more wonderful than a star—the tavern-keepers
whom Puritan England strove to root out—these
have left no memorial and all that we know
about them is just enough to set us guessing
and wondering. The things by which we remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
an old friend—his peculiar laugh, his
way of drawing his hand through his hair, his
whistle in the street, his humour, and the sound
of his footstep on the stair—these things, at any
rate, we cannot hope to recapture in history,
any more than we can recapture last night’s
sunset, or hear again a song sung by Jenny Lind.
The most homely and intimate and personal
things slip through the hands of the historian.
The history that the romanticist in us longs for,
the desire to touch the pulsing heart of men who
toyed with the world as we do, and left it long
ago, is the quest for the most elusive thing in
the world. We who cannot know our own
friends, save in a fragmentary way and at
occasional moments of self-revelation, cannot
hope to read the hearts of half-forgotten kings.
We cannot hope to get close to the lives of
humble men who trod silently through the
world. These we cannot fasten upon at all;
history is thwarted; Earth cannot remember.</p>

<p>History can only make her pictures and
rebuild the past out of the things she can save
from a shipwreck; she will piece together just
so much of the battle of Agincourt as the sea
washes up to the shores. The Memory of the
world is not a bright, shining crystal, but a
heap of broken fragments, a few fine flashes
of light that break through the darkness. And
so, history is full of tales half-told, and of tunes
that break off in the middle; she gives us snatches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
from the lives of men, a peep at some corner of
a battlefield, just enough to make us long for
a fuller vision. All history is full of locked doors,
and of faint glimpses of things that cannot be
reached. The Middle Ages will kick a heel
into the twentieth century, in a Fountains
Abbey—in some straggling ruin—and will ask
us to piece out its former, completed grandeur
for ourselves and to people it with a life of our
own imagining. History can seldom recover
a given set of circumstances and make us see a
definite situation, a particular knot of human
action at a given place and a given time; if two
diplomatists meet in a certain room to settle
a problem, and afterwards describe their proceedings
to their respective governments, or
recall them in memoirs, if Napoleon meets
Metternich in time of crisis at Prague, we can
only recover a dim and faulty account of the
interview from their conflicting descriptions;
and yet this is one of the most precise and clear
situations that a historian might wish to narrate.
And when a Carlyle, in the middle of a rugged
description of the taking of the Bastille, can break
away to apostrophise, in a way that is sublime:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Oh evening sun of July, how, at this hour, thy beams
fell slant on reapers amid peaceful woody fields; on old
women spinning in cottages; on ships far out in the
silent main....</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">he is doing something, he is catching the moment,
in a way that can seldom be achieved in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
history, unless history brings in fiction to help
her. History, then, fails the romanticist. Its
shortcomings become apparent when we try
to particularise, when say, we wish to see a
definite picture. About the closest human
things, history only tells us enough to set us
guessing and wondering.</p>

<p>The history of text-books, the history that
can be made out of the recoverable facts of the
past, is really little more than a chart to the
past. If people think of England there flashes
in upon them a panorama, of green fields and
telegraph-posts, and intersecting roads and
clusters of houses. “England” comes home to
us as a jumble of pictures that melt into one
another and that we have caught perhaps from
the windows of a railway-carriage as we have
darted across country. Similarly, if we unlock
the past in our minds a score of pictures leap
before us, breaking into one another. And the
history that history-books can tell us bears a
relation to that picture which we make for ourselves
of the past, something like the relation
which a map of England bears to that mental
picture that we form of the English countryside.
And just as when we look at an ordnance
map we can see where a path runs and can tell
where it strikes up hill or down dale, where it
touches a wood and where it follows a stream,
but if we wish to make a picture of the walk we
must put in the hawthorn-hedges, the pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
turns of the path, and the rocky edge of the
stream for ourselves—so when we read history,
if we wish not merely to see great figures
strutting upon a stage, acting a public part,
but to fill in the lines of the picture with the
robust life of the countryside, and to catch the
hundred human touches, if we wish, say, to see
the vivid life of three hundred years ago stirring
in the crooked streets and topsy-turvy houses
that converge upon York Minster, we must
charge our history with some of the human
things that are irrecoverable, we must reinforce
history by our imagination. The public life of
great men is before our eyes, some of their
private life is open to us; but the life that fills
the street with bustle, that makes every corner
of a slum a place of wonder and interest, the
life that is a sad and gay, weary and thrilling
thing in every hillside cottage, is a dim blurred
picture in a history. Because of this, history
cannot come so near to human hearts and human
passions as a good novel can; its very fidelity
to facts makes it not perhaps less true to life,
but farther away from the heart of things. All
the real history of people that a text-book could
give is like the chart of Treasure Island—just
enough to set a wild heart dreaming; the chart
gives generalities, it describes the lie of the land,
but if we wish to <em>see</em> a picture of Treasure
Island we must make the chart the jumping-off
board for some play of the imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>There is a poem, called “The Old Ships,” in
which Flecker tells of how he has seen vessels,
“with leaden age o’er cargoed,” sail “beyond
the village which men still call Tyre.” These
ships, like everything that survives from the
past, are a hint to the imagination; they suggest
a story; and this is the kind of thinking to
which they drive the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indentq">“And all those ships were certainly so old,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It was so old a ship—who knows, who knows?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">In these lines is shown the lure of all ancient
things that store a tale which they cannot tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>There is a charm and mystery in unremembered
things. There is something fine in the
sight of a ridge of hill against the sky when one
does not know what lies beyond or whether
a surprise of rolling sea beneath a sudden fall
of cliff, or a panorama of wooded valleys, is
in store at the summit—so one can only guess
and wonder. And, when, in some border-village
we look at hills that have watched
centuries stride by, and ask ourselves of distant
scenes and old adventure that the hills must
have overlooked, and when we learn that
these matters were writ in water and that about
them not history any more than the stern hill-crags
can break her everlasting silence—then
here is adventure for the imagination, and in
our fancy we play around places that we know
and events that we have heard of, weaving
around “What-has-been” the things that might
have been. We do the kind of thinking that is
needed to turn a map into a picture, the kind of
thinking that might translate last year’s National
Budget into a drama of hearts and homes.</p>

<p>It is in this that there lies the first justification
of the historical novel, and one way of
giving that particular kind of literature a relation
to experience. No infallible generalisation
can give a key to all historical novels and to
everything that appears in them, but here at
least is a useful key that will fit many locks and
will explain much that there is in all these novels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and moreover will provide a system of relations
between these and the history that is a study. It
cannot be too strongly stated that the explanation
of historical novels is not to be found in the fact
that history needs an admixture of fiction to
give it spice, to make it exciting, to relieve the
boredom. Truth is stranger than fiction and
some of the most incredible episodes that have
been found in novels have been those which an
author has too foolishly taken straight from life.
That there is a place for such a thing as the
historical novel is due to a certain inadequacy in
history itself. History is full of events and issues
out of which a story could be made, and of
adventures that are exciting enough; it is not
wanting in incident, but these things are not
stories, they have to be transmuted into story;
for there are irrecoverable things in history, and
these are the close, intimate personal things,
the touches of direct experience that are needed
in story-making, the things that we most remember
in friends we used to have, what might
be called “the human touches.” In order to
catch these things in the life of the past, and to
make a bygone age live again, history must not
merely be eked out by fiction, it must not merely
be extended by invented episodes; it must be
turned into a novel; it must be “put to fiction”
as a poem is put to music.</p>

<p>When history tells us that Napoleon did a
certain thing, it is the work of each of us, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
trying to bring history home to ourselves, to
amplify in our imagination what the history-book
gives us, and to <em>see</em> Napoleon doing the
action. It is all very well to be told that a certain
event took place, but the past strikes home in
our minds with immeasurably greater power if
we can see it happening and can catch it as a
picture; and this is what we try to do for ourselves
when we read a history-book. The
important thing is to see the past, and not simply
to hear somebody describe it. It is not enough
to read of a certain event; we must be there,
watching—we must fix it into a picture for
ourselves, we must recapture the particular
moment. History does not do this for us; just
the thing that it cannot do is to catch the moment
precisely; so we do this for ourselves; we
complete history in our supposition. Every
man who has an idea of the woman Mary
Queen of Scots, or who can catch glimpses of
what happened at Waterloo, has added to history
something from his own imagination, and has
filled in the lines for himself. The past as it
exists for all of us, the world of the past in our
minds, is history synthesised by the imagination,
and fixed into a picture by something that
mounts to fiction. For history fails when a
certain situation is to be recovered, or a definite
combination of circumstances is to be seized
upon, or a particular moment is to be caught.
And yet it is a cold and bloodless thing if these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
things cannot be achieved, and the life of the
past is not in any way resurrected without them.
The chart must be turned into a picture, if
history is to be a recovery of the life of the past
and not a mere post-mortem examination. The
imagination of the historian does this for him;
the most musty of parchments holds for him a
story and speaks to a world that exists in his
mind; but everybody is not a historian; so
historical fiction does the work for all the world;
it fuses the past into a picture, and makes it live.</p>

<p>Again, any attempt to recapture the past is
limited and inadequate if it keeps a reader
conscious of the fact that he is a modern
creature, looking at a distant world and comparing
it with his own. It is not enough to
recover the facts of the lives that men lived
long-ago and to trace out the thread of event;
we must recover the adventure of their lives;
and the whole fun and adventure of their lives,
as of ours, hung on the fact that at any given
moment they could not see ahead, and did not
know what was coming. To the men of 1807
the year 1808 was a mystery and an unexplored
tract; they saw a hundred possibilities in it
where the modern reader only sees the one
thing that actually happened; they never knew
what surprise awaited them at the next turn in
the road; and therefore, to study the year 1807
remembering all the time what happened in
1808 and in the succeeding trail of years, is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
miss the adventure and the great uncertainties
and the element of gamble in their lives. It is
not enough to know that Napoleon won a certain
battle; if history is to come back to us as a
human thing we must see him on the eve of
battle eagerly looking to see which way the
dice will fall, with fears and hesitations perhaps,
with a sense of all the things that may happen
in spite of all his calculations, and with an uncertainty
before all the range of possible things
that may upset his plans. The victory that is
achieved on one day must not be regarded as
being inevitable the night before; and where we
cannot help seeing the certainty of a desired
issue, the men of the time were all suspense, and
full of wonderings. History does not always
give us things like these, for they are irrecoverable
personal things; but we know they existed.
They are the things that make life an experience.
And they are the very touches that are needed
to turn history into a story.</p>

<p>These things are what are meant, then, when
it is affirmed that the history that Romanticism
in all of us demands must be at once a picture
and story. And it is in this way that the history-book
which belongs to the “literature of knowledge”
is transformed into the “literature of
power.”</p>

<p>In the opening chapter of <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> there is a
piece of writing that illustrates the difference
between the historian and the historical novelist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
in the use that they make of the same historical
material. In the introductory part of that
chapter Scott recapitulates, “for the information
of the general reader,” the conditions of
the age with which he is dealing, describing
them in general terms as a historian would.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Four generations (he writes) had not sufficed to
blend the hostile blood of the Normans and Anglo-Saxons,
or to unite, by common language and mutual
interests, two hostile races, one of which still felt the
elation of triumph, while the other groaned under all
the consequences of defeat.... At court and in the castles
of the great nobles, where the pomp and state of a court
was emulated, Norman-French was the only language
employed; in courts of law, the pleading and judgments
were delivered in the same tongue. In short, French
was the language of honour, of chivalry and even of
justice, while the far more manly and expressive Anglo-Saxon
was abandoned to the use of rustics and hinds
who knew no other. Still, however, the necessary intercourse
between the lords of the soil, and those oppressed
inferior beings by whom that soil was cultivated, occasioned
the gradual formation of a dialect, compounded
betwixt the French and the Anglo-Saxon, in which they
could render themselves mutually intelligible to each
other; and from this necessity arose by degrees the
structure of our present English language, in which the
speech of the victor and the vanquished have been so
happily blended together; and which has since been so
richly improved by importations from the classical
languages, and from those spoken by the southern
nations of Europe.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a history-lesson. A conflict of forces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
a set of tendencies is described in what might
be a chapter straight from a history-book. Scott
is showing the position that the English language
occupied at a given period, and is making
the sort of generalisation that it is the historian’s
business to make. We are not being treated to
an essay by Dryasdust; there is imagination in
the depiction that is given; but this is the
historian’s way of treating historical facts; it is
essentially the past being described to later ages,
it is not the past telling its own tale, giving
itself away; and it is a chart to the age rather
than a picture. Even in a further sense than
this the historian speaks in his peculiar idiom;
for he not only describes the world as it was at
some time past, but he hauls this world into
relationship with the whole of subsequent
development and puts it in its place in the whole
cinematograph-film that is History. In the
concluding sentence he gives the significance
of that conflict of languages which he has been
describing, and sees it as a link in the whole
story of our language. And because of this
the reader does not lose himself in the past; he
stands aside to compare it with the present. This
part of the chapter gives in reality the stage-directions
of the novel, and it reminds the
reader that he is not in the past, and so breaks
the spell.</p>

<p>In the ensuing dialogue, however, where
Wamba and Gurth have to contemplate “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
swine being turned Normans,” this same historical
material is translated into terms of
fiction. It is not stretched, or varnished, or
distorted. The novelist does not try to outdo
history by invention, or to round off the true
historical position by a kind of idealisation; at
least the significance of the chapter does not lie
in any of these things. What is important is
the fact that here the same historical material
is given to the reader in a different way, and is
treated with a different aim. Instead of the
general there is now the particular. Tendencies
that were broadly described before are given
precision, we see what they mean when they
are pinned down to individual cases. Before,
we were given the formula for the age; now we
see the forces that were described manifesting
themselves at a definite place, at a particular
moment. Here the past speaks for itself. We
see it and are in it, we do not simply hear a man
describing it. And instead of that conflict of
languages being put into its context in the
history of language, the novelist puts it into
its context in the whole life of the time, and
hunts out a different set of implications in it.
All this comes with greater vividness to the
reader. History is reinforced by being written
in the story-teller’s way.</p>

<p>This is one example taken from a chapter in
which the historian and the historical novelist
chance to rub shoulders with each other, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the idea is capable of being projected on to a
larger canvas. In the Introduction to <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>
Scott shows how all this can be extended when,
in terms of the historian, he again describes the
set of facts, which he has turned into fiction, the
chart which he has changed into a picture; this
time on a bigger scale, covering the whole range
of the novel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It seemed to the author that the existence of two
races in the same country, the vanquished distinguished
by their plain, homely, blunt manner, and the free spirit
infused by their ancient institutions and laws; the victors,
by the high spirit of military fame, personal adventure
and whatever could distinguish them as the Flower of
Chivalry might, intermixed with other characters
belonging to the same time and country, interest the
reader by the contrast, if the author should not fail on
his part.</p>
</div>

<p>This is a description of a mere relationship
between classes of a society. Scott sees in it a
story. He divines in it just the situations and
issues out of which a story can be made. He
sees its implications in individual lives. Instead
of contemplating its effects on future generations
he lays bare its workings in the scheme of
life of people who lived under it. Just as a
prism catches the light and turns it into colours
he stands between the historical generalisation
and his readers and he breaks up the general into
the particular and projects it as a picture. The
result is like the condensing of a cloud into raindrops.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
Fiction is like the dust which creates a
sunbeam and helps the sunlight to show that it
is there. And in this way Scott does something
for history that the historian by himself cannot
do, or can seldom do; he recaptures the life of
an age, and resurrects a picture of the past.</p>

<p>The historical novelist receives his hint from
history, but such examples as these from
<cite>Ivanhoe</cite> are enough to make it apparent that
this hint need not necessarily be a story ready-made,
a sequence of events to be followed. Many
historical novels are stories straight from a history-book—the
adventures of Guy Fawkes, the
sorrows of Mary Queen of Scots—amplified
and rounded off by fiction perhaps, and re-told
with some variations. History may provide plot
and adventure, and fiction may just fill in the
lines where history is inadequate or idealise
incidents and careers where history is incomplete
or disappointing. It is claimed of some
of Jokai’s novels that, staged as they are in
lands where passion and action are intense and
full of colour, and drawn as they are from a
history that is crowded with romantic and
thrilling episodes, they do not need an invention
of incident or a perversion of history to make
them complete, but are just a vivid re-telling of
things that actually happened. The books of
Dumas are filled with incidents and situations
that are picked straight from history and are
marvellously connected into an organised story.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
And many writers have assimilated into the body
of their novels incidents that are true to fact
or anecdotes from legend, and so have made
history and fiction fit into each other in dovetail
fashion. All this represents one way in
which history can be incorporated into a novel,
but it is not the only way; and the particular
fact that is brought to light by the Introduction
to <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>, as well as by other things, is the
fact that history does not merely inspire fiction
by providing a tale, a thread of incident, a network
of action, to be re-told in story-book
fashion; it may only provoke a tale, it may just
provide situations and relationships and problems
which give the right kind of issue that is
needed in story-making. Scott saw implicit in
the conditions of the age of Richard I a set of
human relationships which were materials for
a novel. He had the power of divining the
implied story that was hidden beneath a description
of Anglo-Norman relations a few
generations after the Conquest.</p>

<p>Everything in life is full of implied story.
Every piece of coal stores up history and a tale
of marvel. Parish accounts that tell of a leap
in the amount of money spent upon “faggots”
in the sixteenth century hold a hidden story of
persecution and martyrdom. There is a tragedy
that can be read into many a newspaper advertisement,
and there are people in the world
who can see the adventure and the wandering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
and the panorama that are locked up in a railway-guide.
The geography of Africa that might be
a dull recapitulation of facts and figures might
be turned into narrative, into a story of travels
across an unknown continent. And if a politician
wishes to bring home to people the
consequences of an unwelcome measure he has
only to work out a particular instance of hardship
that may result from the measure, giving
it preciseness and turning it into a story, and he
will catch the imagination of electors far sooner
than any logic could convince their intellects.
It is in this way that the novelist recasts historical
material into story-form, and it is in this way
that history is made more effectual than the
history-book.</p>

<p>Here, then, are the two ways by which history
passes into a novel. In the one case it merely
gives material that can be woven into story in
the same way as a geography-book can be translated
into a book of travel; in the other case it
provides a story which a writer has to work into
his own fictions. The former method is, in a
way, organic, since what it prescribes is that a
writer shall be true to the life of the past in his
inventions; it gives the key in which he must
set his tune. According to this, history supplies
the metal and the novelist creates the mould.
He may invent the characters, the dialogues, the
whole range of incident through which it is his
aim to make History speak for herself; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
need not distort the characters of actual historical
people to fit them into his story, or do violence
to the chronological table in order to draw
together the threads of his plot. But the second
method implies a further fidelity to the facts of
the history-book and to the sequence of public
events, and it may be called a comparatively
“mechanical” method in that it means that a
story taken from history has to be dovetailed
into the fictions of the novelist; the business is
one of adjustment, and sometimes a wrench has
to be given to history in order to subdue it to
the demands of the novel. And although
seldom or never can a historical novel be found
in which either of these methods is completely
isolated, yet they are two separate things, representing
a double set of demands that History
makes upon the writer of novels, and they yield
some fruitful results if they are regarded separately.
Wamba and Gurth are representatives
of the one method; and in the same novel
Richard I and Robin Hood stand for the other
method, since their existence implies stories
from history and legend that are required to be
adjusted to the inventions of the novelist.</p>

<p>To say therefore that Scott, in <cite>Ivanhoe</cite>,
translated into terms of fiction the piece of
historical material, the set of human relationships
which in his Introduction he described
as being the basis of the novel, is only true in
a general way. But this was the principal thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
that Scott did; and in it he showed his greatest
power, and the historical novel displayed its
finest virtue. In the Introduction to <cite>The
Monastery</cite> he makes a similar confession of the
key-idea of his novel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The general plan of the story was, to conjoin two
characters in that bustling and contentious age, who,
thrown into situations which gave them different views
on the subject of the reformation, should, with the same
sincerity and purity of intention, dedicate themselves,
the one to the support of the sinking fabric of the Catholic
Church, the other to the establishment of the reformed
doctrines. It was supposed that some interesting subjects
for narrative might be derived from opposing two
such enthusiasts to each other in the path of life, and
contrasting the real worth of both with their passions
and prejudices.</p>
</div>

<p>Here again is a set of historical conditions
which, even when described in so rough and swift
a fashion, are full of implied story. To turn
these into a novel necessitates no distortion of
great historical events; what the writer does is
to hunt out those situations and problems which
are implicit in the life of the age and in the
described conditions, and which are the kind of
issues that make good story. In the same way
the very title, <cite>The Cloister and the Hearth</cite>, suggesting
as it does a collision of loyalties and a
human problem, is a description of something
in mediaeval life that cries out to be turned into
a tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>The conditions of the life of the present-day,
the current habits of thought, the social relationships
of men, the economic situation of the
country, the welfare of family and Church, and
the relations of those institutions and groups that
make their conflicting claims upon the loyalty
and cover so much of the activity of individuals,
are rich with problems and anomalies, and
situations and combinations of circumstance
which are peculiar to the age, and are the source
of most of the issues of the novel of the present-day.
The entanglement of the individuals in
these conditions produces problems of experience
that are peculiarly modern. In the same
way every set of circumstances produces its
special set of human issues, every age has its
own life-problems; and the novel of an age of
monasticism will range through a different
scheme of problems from that of an age of
divorce-law activity, and the world of the
Industrial Movement will show life dominated
by issues different from those of the age of
Chivalry. The twentieth century differs from
the twelfth not merely in its language, its dress,
its implements and armour, but in its whole
experience of life. It is not merely in the suits
and trappings that one age contrasts with
another; and for this reason the historical novel
is justified, as something more than picturesque
scene-painting, for it treats of other ages’
experiments in living, and depicts human nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
breaking in upon a different set of experiences,
a different range of problems. When Scott in
the Introductions to <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> and to <cite>The Monastery</cite>
summarises a state of society therefore, and
assumes a given set of human relationships as
the basis of a novel, he is carrying with these
things the whole range of experiences and
issues that are involved in them and that are
peculiar to them, and his purpose is to turn
these into story as a present-day novelist turns
the social conditions of the twentieth century
into fiction.</p>

<p>History, then, is not merely a taskmaster to
the novelist. Too often the historical novelist
has been spoken of as being hampered by history
and tied down by chronological tables. He has
been regarded as a novelist working under
limitations and with one hand tied, history
restricting his imagination, and setting him a
boundary. But all that has just been said implies
that history is not merely the chain that
ties the novelist down; rather it is the wing that
helps him to soar into a new range of problems
and experiences. It is his inspiration, and not
simply a tie. When Scott in his Introductions
gave himself a basis for his novels it is true that
he was accepting certain limitations and agreeing
to work within a given set of facts, just as an
Arctic explorer agrees to accept the hardships
of cold weather; but at the same time he was
opening up to himself a different world and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
life that rested on a different basis and that so
provided him with a host of fresh story-issues.</p>

<p>If the historical novelist regards his duty as
being to avoid anachronisms, history will seem
to him a chain. The different condition of
things existing in the period of which he writes
will be a source of labour to him, and a pitfall.
But to the true historical novelist they are a
glory, they are the whole point of his work, and
what was a weakness becomes a strength. If
a writer wishes to “work up” a period in order
to set a story in it, he will feel history a fetter
and every unexpected fact may hamper the
story he intended to tell. But if he has steeped
his mind in some past age, and has lived in that
age, turning it over and over in his imagination,
realising the conditions of affairs and the relationships
of men and pondering over the
implications of these and so recasting the life
of the age for himself, then that particular age
and those special conditions will suggest their
own story, and the historical peculiarities of
that age will give point to his novel and will
become a power. There is all the difference
in the world between a man who has a story
to tell and wishes to set it in a past age and to
adjust it to the demands of history, and the man
who has the past in his head and allows it to come
forth in story. There is an immense gulf between
the man who works up a period in history in
order to tell his story without anachronisms, and
a man whose stories come from a mind steeped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
in the past. In the one case history has to
be laboriously gathered up around the story,
and it is a burden; in the other case the history
is there to begin with, and the story grows out
of the history. In the true historical novel the
writer has learned to feel at home in the age
with which he is dealing. Such a novel comes
out of a world of the Past that exists in the
writer’s mind. The history that it embodies
will be true or inaccurate according as the man
has throughout his life built up that world in
his mind on true foundations, but in any case
that history will come spontaneously; and here
the historical novelist is not a novelist working
under limitations, but one who has captured
new fields of experience and of circumstance
and has conquered a new world for his art.</p>

<p>In all this, too, there can further be worked
out a defence of the historical novel against one
of the charges that are sometimes brought up
against it. The historical novel is specially open
to the temptation of mere picturesqueness. The
one thing that is essentially to be kept in mind
in the whole idea of history that has been
described above, is not that this method of
treating the past is shallow, but that it is specially
liable to descend to shallowness without knowing
and to be satisfied with mere externals, and
pageantry, and a veneer of history. Popular
literature is full of empty fiction that sets a conventional
story in a picturesque background and
thinks it has done justice to history when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
has clothed its personages in coloured costumes
and given their language a touch of the obsolete,
and raised up a stage-setting of courts and
camps and Gothic architecture; and the drawback
to the historical novel lies in the fact that
the touch of strangeness, the sense of the far-away,
the hint of colour and romance in all
these, too often makes the emptiness of the
show more tolerable; the fine feathers disguise
the worthlessness of the bird below. But if it
is remembered that every state of society has
its peculiar experience of life, that every age of
history shows mankind breaking in upon experience
and upon the problems of life at
different points, and that each generation has
its attitude to existence, and its peculiar synthesis,
then it must be seen that the charge of
shallowness is not one that can be made against
the whole idea of historical novels, and that these,
like any other novel, may be rich with experience
and may touch human issues. A story that
describes a Roman watching the decay of the
Empire that he had been taught would endure
for ever, and seeing a surging barbarian life
flood into its borders like some awful eruption
of Nature before which human effort is futile
and men can only look helplessly on, may be a
mere melodrama, unredeemed by its pageantry
and picturesqueness; but it can be more—the
story of a unique experience, and of one of the
urgent moments in the life of mankind. Shallowness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
is not the evil of the historical novel—it is
only its danger.</p>

<p>Lastly, it may be said that the inspiration of
the historical novel is not merely history, but
also geography. To a person for whom history
did not exist at all a landscape would be merely
a flat picture; to one who can think history into
it, it has a dimension in time. To some people
the ruins of Rome may be a poor heap of fragments,
pieces of broken art-ware; but to Gibbon
and Gregorovius who brought to the place a
sense of the history behind, those ruins were
the starting-point of a trail that led back to the
glories of ancient Rome and were the clue to
a story. If people re-tread the scenes of a
distant childhood it is not merely a flat picture
that comes before their eyes, but other scenes
behind it, scenes that the memory has stored
and that are somehow locked up in the present
one; the very landscape looks different, and is
richer because it breathes the past. To an architect
a building is not merely a dead weight of
stone, but a mass of forces striking in different
directions and brought somehow to a poise;
the whole structure is thrilled with life and in
every line of it there is motion. To a historical
mind similarly, a building must <em>look</em> different.
It has not merely length and breadth and height,
but also a certain “throughness,” an extension
in time; behind the “Now” of that building
there is a long trail of Moments of the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
building, the place has not merely a few associations
with the past but a whole context in history;
and the sight of the walls at the present time is
only the last picture of a cinematograph-reel
which represents all the hundred Yesterdays
that are folded up within the stone. Our fleeting
“Now” is only the last term of an ever-lengthening
series. Time is locked up within scenery and
buildings; and the aim of history is to unlock it
and to make it speak its secret.</p>

<p>What we call historic sites and buildings
represent places in which this secret has in some
measure been recovered. They have not existed
longer than other places in geography, but they are
places about which History can remember things.
The cinematograph-film which represents their
extension in time is not completely locked away
from us; and the historical mind means among
other things the power to feel the film there and
to recall pictures in it at the mere sight of the
place, on the mere suggestion of geography.</p>

<p>In Sir Walter Scott this power of reading
history into places existed in real intensity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To me (he said) the wandering over the field of
Bannockburn was the source of more exquisite pleasure
than gazing upon the celebrated landscape from the
battlement of Stirling Castle. I do not by any means
infer that I was dead to the feeling or picturesque
scenery—but show me an old castle in a field of battle
and I was at home at once....</p>
</div>

<p>If he saw a scene about which tradition or the
history-book had nothing to tell, he still saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
the history there, and tried to read the past into
the place. Someone wrote of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He was but half-satisfied with the most beautiful
scenery when he could not connect it with some local
legend, and when I was forced sometimes to confess
with the knife-grinder “Story! God bless you! I have
none to tell, sir,” he would laugh and say “then let us
make one—nothing so easy as to make a tradition.”</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Such a story invented around a place, such an
attempt to call up history out of a scene, is
really an act of homage, an offering made to the
place, a work of dedication.</p>

<p>History is rooted in geography, and the
historical novel, which is a novel that seeks to
be rooted in some ways in actuality, finds one of
its roots in geography. The quotation made
above from Scott’s Introduction to <cite>The Monastery</cite>
is part of an explanation which the author
gives of the reason why he chose the celebrated
ruins of Melrose as the scene of his story,
although he described the place as “possessing
less of romantic beauty than some other scenes
in Scotland.” Of Jokai it has been said “The
world around him—Hungary, Russia, and
Turkey—breathed more romance and imagination
than did the Highlands to Scott or France
to Dumas”; and here was the inspiration of
the writer.</p>

<p>Historical novels are born of romanticism
of a kind; but they are a romancing around
objects and places; they have a basis in reality,
and their roots in the soil. In this way there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
something more firm about them than is found
in the more vague and dreamy products of
romanticism—those dim romances of some
undefined no-time, no-place, which have a
“stained-glass window” vision of a mediaeval
past and lack the link with earth, and can only
be connected with the historical novel in the
way a fairy-story can, that is by the remote
suggestion of the past that is contained in the
airy words “Once upon a time.”</p>

<p>And if in the historical novel there is devotion
to locality and a feeling for the history that
breathes through the soil, all this comes out
large and most complete where geography and
tradition, love of place and pride in its heritage
of story, combine in patriotism. Patriotism that
so often rings false is in this true, in that it
becomes the consciousness of belonging to a
place and a tradition. Even where it seems
most local and confined, even where it contains
no sounding of the trumpets of nationalism,
and where its author holds no patriotic motive,
the historical novel cannot help reminding men
of their heritage in the soil. It is often born of
a kind of patriotism; it can scarcely avoid always
being the inspiration of it. In this way it becomes
itself a power in history, an impulse to
fine feeling, and a source of more of the action
and heroism which it describes. The historical
novel itself becomes a maker of history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II">II</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> has been noticed that the ostensible theme of
<cite>The Cloister and the Hearth</cite> is an instance of a
human problem that came out in a particular
form in mediaeval life, but exists in some form
in every society. The problem is one of loyalties
that cut across each other and pull different
ways. A modern novelist would be likely to
treat this as a study in human experience and
would analyse the disruption it would cause in
the individual soul. Reade, however, is a
Victorian, who lived before the psychological
novel had become the fashion, and he does the
Victorian thing; instead of treating this problem
as the real theme of his novel, he pushes it on
one side, and makes it simply the excuse for
sending his hero on a journey, so that his story
becomes very largely a story of travel.</p>

<p>The simplest kind of novel is the novel of
this kind, which gives a string of happenings
that befell the hero in his wandering through the
world. It is not the working-out of a plot, or the
following-up of a situation. It does not turn
upon a definite set of relations which provide
a problem for the novelist to solve, a knot for
him to untie; it does not hunt down a given set
of circumstances to some logical issue. It is
simply a chain of happenings, an accumulation
of incident; one episode does not grow out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
another, each leading to something deeper; but
events merely succeed one another at various
turns in the road which the hero has to travel,
and the only connection between them is that
they all happen to the same person. Dickens is
an example of this kind of novelist, who takes
any excuse for sending his hero on his travels,
and narrates the various things that turn up on
the journey. The <cite>Pickwick Papers</cite> belong to
this class, for they do not represent a scheme of
action working to a certain issue, but are a
chain of episodes that never lead to anything
and might continue for ever. In the adventures
of Pickwick, therefore, Dickens is really describing
a world in which his hero is wandering;
just as in <cite>David Copperfield</cite> he is not so much
revealing a character as painting the world that
his hero passed through in his life’s journey.
Such novels are really tales of travel; the world
of the story is not merely the background for
the hero, the setting for the story; rather the
hero is the excuse for describing the world.
Sometimes that world is a topsy-turvy place,
like the one that bewildered Pickwick, or the
fantastic “Wonderland” that Alice found herself
in; sometimes it is a Lilliput, or some
imagined future state of things, or it may even
be modern society. In a historical novel it will
be some past age, described as a far-country.</p>

<p>The simplest form of treatment that can be
given to history in the novel is that of the story
in which the hero travels a bygone age, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
reader follows him as into a new world and peeps
over his shoulder to see what he sees. The age,
the whole scheme of things as it then existed,
is described in the adventures of the wanderer
and at its point of contact with an individual
life. This happens to some extent in every
historical novel. Apart from any conscious
description of the background of his story the
novelist must always be betraying the peculiar
conditions of a particular century, since the fate
and fortunes of the actors in his drama are the
result of their entanglement in the affairs of the
time and in the system of things of the particular
moment. But in a work like <cite>The Cloister and
the Hearth</cite> all this is raised into a method and
is the way adopted for making history betray
itself; the wanderings of the hero make the
book pre-eminently a descriptive one, and the
fact that the novel is rather a chain of incident
than the working out of a particular process of
action, makes the world of the story more
important than the plot. The hardships of
Gerard at strange inns, his illnesses, the brawls
in the countryside, the companions whom he
meets, and the steps in his career are simply
the means by which the age manifests its
character, and in them history is speaking.
There can be no simpler example than this of
the translation of history into story.</p>

<p>In so far as this method of treating the past
is followed in <cite>The Cloister and the Hearth</cite> or in
any novel, it means that an age is regarded as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
a set of conditions, a system of things, that is
looked upon as static and is described at its
points of contact with an individual life set in
it and, so to speak, entangled in its network.
That individual may be the creation of the
novelist and his chain of adventures may be pure
invention. His life is a candle that lights up
corners of his age as it is brought into them, and
the places at which he touches his age and runs
up against the characteristic circumstances of
his time, his points of contact with the machinery
of society, may be ideally chosen to show up the
character of his time. His life may then sum
up his age in a way in which no actual individual
life that is ever lived can in itself sum up the
peculiar conditions of the age in which it is
set. In <cite>The Cloister and the Hearth</cite>, at any rate,
a century is fixed for us as a picture, as a static
thing. The cinematograph-film of history is
stopped there, and one particular photograph
on the reel is projected into the book.</p>

<p>All this, however, is elaborated when the set
of conditions to be described is regarded not
as a static thing, but as dynamic. <cite>Barnaby
Rudge</cite>, by reason of its very faults, perhaps more
than by virtue of any greatness, is an example
well calculated to illustrate this point.</p>

<p>The first section of this book is a love-story
very largely conventional. It is not a piece from
a historical novel at all; the slight references to
history and the picturesqueness of background<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
and costume are not in themselves sufficient
to give this story of homely private life the
character of historical fiction. Nothing that
happens is calculated to make a particular age
of the past betray itself; there is no chord that
awakens a response from History. Nothing but
the slight element of colour and picturesqueness
exists to prevent this from being a story of any
century; and at the most there is only the
suggestion of an indefinable Past such as is so
attractive to the shallow romantic novelist.</p>

<p>In the middle of the book, however, as if by
an afterthought the reader is introduced to that
uprising of the people which is known as the
Gordon Riots. In the fervour of describing the
riotous mass-movement Dickens seems to forget
his original plot and to lose sight of his principal
characters. The story loses itself in a vivid sketch
of the Gordon Riots, and the original problems
of the book are only solved in a perfunctory
way at the close. The reader who has made
himself interested in the homely affairs of the
Willets and Vardons is irritated to find that
these are pushed on one side, and that the whole
novel takes a swerve in a different direction.</p>

<p>And yet the bareness of the historical setting
of the first section of the book, and the lack of
all suggestion of a political background or of
any complication of individual issues by larger
political events, sets out in more effective contrast
the later theme of the novel, that irresistible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
sweep of a great mob-action rushing like a
blight over any corner of life that lies in its
path. If the Gordon Riots come like a flood
into <cite>Barnaby Rudge</cite>, playing havoc with the
fortunes of the story and swallowing up everything
they meet, it is what they do in real life.
If the reader loses sight of the men and women
in whose fate he has become interested, and if
all that he can catch is an occasional glimpse of
them, lost or helpless in a crowded surging
stream of life, it is what would have happened
to them if the flood had carried them away in
actual existence. The very faults of <cite>Barnaby
Rudge</cite> as a piece of construction, its irritating
weaknesses as a story, are calculated to intensify
the effect that a historian of some popular
upheaval must always try to obtain—the effect
of a sweeping, ravaging flood that surges over
the peaceful lives of individuals and swallows up
men and their homes and their little aims and
concerns, and leaves a devastated track behind.</p>

<p>A similar treatment of a historic movement
occurs in <cite>A Tale of Two Cities</cite>; but in this case,
precisely because Dickens kept a closer hold
upon his story and fixed his eyes more steadily
upon his principal characters and his main
issues—precisely because he did not lose himself
in the setting of his novel, in the “world” of
his story—the same cataclysmic result is not so
apparent, the tremendous sweep of the destroying
storm is not so graphically reproduced. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
story is less irritating because we do not lose
sight of the characters whose fate is the theme
of the novel, but the Revolution does not come
so powerfully as a devastating wave and at the
same time it does not come with the awful
precipitancy of the Gordon Riots in <cite>Barnaby
Rudge</cite>, but it is anticipated and prepared for in
advance. Still, even here, the historical idea that
stands out is the spectacle of a movement of the
people that is overwhelming in the havoc that
it plays with the individual lives and concerns
caught within its orbit.</p>

<p>In these instances the set of conditions in
which the individual is involved are not static,
but dynamic; and the character of them, and
the sweep of them, come out at their points of
contact with individual lives, and are revealed
in the way they touch the concerns of men and
break in upon the personal fortunes of a few
people. In these instances, therefore, the wind
is described by its effect on the feather that
drifts helplessly in it, and we follow the flood by
keeping our eyes on some particular object
floating in it and swept forward by it. All this
would be sufficient to make a historical novel
and to justify it; for such a novel would in a
way outstrip the history-book in the telling of
history, since it would not merely describe a
distant past to us, but would take us into it; it
would not be a telescope as history is, enabling
us to see something far away, but would be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
bridge leading us over the gulf that divides past
and present, and so annihilating time. In such
a novel we should see the past from the point
of view of the past, and recapture an age as it
comes to individuals in it; we should be not
merely twentieth-century spectators watching a
distant scene, but would become contemporary
with the past, and having an inside knowledge
of it. In all this the historical novel would
challenge the history-book in its own fields.</p>

<p>But this does not span the full range of this
kind of novel; it omits something that historical
novelists almost always go out of their way to
achieve. Here the incidents and adventure of
the novel may be purely fictitious, and the
characters may be inventions; and only the
world in which they are placed, the currents
that sweep over their lives, and the movements
that overwhelm them need to be real; the novel
is true to the life of the past, and is faithful to
the age with which it is concerned, regarding
the age as a set of conditions to be conformed
with. It is true to the spirit of the age; and may
describe the past as a far-country; but it may
have nothing to do with the actual events of
the past, and with history regarded as a chain
of story. Every happening that it relates may
be an invention; and it can do all that has just
been claimed for it without containing any
specific incident that ever took place. It may
tell its history by revealing history in its workings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
in an imaginary life set in it; in the same way
as a teacher may illustrate the force of gravity
to children by talking about its workings on an
imaginary apple. It may be in a way true to
history without being true to fact.</p>

<p>If a story is told us about some spot with
which we are acquainted, then, although the
story may not be true, it touches us somewhere,
it has a root in actuality and so makes us listen,
in a way which would be impossible if the story
were told, so to speak, in the air. If we hear
some anecdote that is narrated about a friend
of ours it holds us even if we know it is a legend,
in a way which it could not do if it had not
fastened itself upon something real. If a story
can plant one foot in actuality then it belongs no
more to the clouds, and it gains an added power
from having established a connection with
reality. It is this kind of additional effectiveness
that historical novelists seek to obtain. They are
not satisfied that the world of their story shall
be true to the world of the past, and that situations
and incident shall grow out of that world.
Their novel is not merely background, but
story, and to them history is not merely the
world as it once was, but also a quarry of incident.
And once a novel is regarded as a story,
and incidents or episodes are looked upon as
the important thing, the units in it, the things
into which the chapters arrange themselves—then
a historical novel is still “in the air,” and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
is only historical in a vague and unconvincing
way, and lacks one of the strongest roots in
actuality, if its events are fictitious and its
characters imaginary, so that nothing in the
story ever really “happened.” There is a great
difference between the novel that simply lights
up the history of an age, and illustrates the
conditions of the time, and one which is itself
a piece of historical narrative. It is when the
reader can feel that the things that are being
related actually took place, and that the man
about whom the stories are being told really
lived although the stories about him may not
all be true; it is when the thread of incident
in the novel, as well as what might be called
the texture of the book, can in some way be
called “historical,” that the work is most
effective in its grip on actuality. And if this is
true, an author looking at the life of the past
and at the things that happened in history is
like the artist looking upon a scene in nature
and “longing to do something with it,” longing
to turn it into something and to recreate it, in
such a way as to express himself as well as to
reproduce actuality.</p>

<p>In <cite>A Tale of Two Cities</cite>, then, Dickens was
content to describe the grim fires of the French
Revolution not directly, but in the reflection
that they threw upon a few imaginary individuals;
the events that were “historical” in the sense of
being memorable, the public events that held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the stage at the time, he was content to portray
in their effects upon the homely lives of one or
two fictitious characters. But there is a more
direct and pointed way of transferring things
from history into the novel, and this method,
when superimposed upon the other, gives a
story an added link with actuality. In any novel
adventures and incidents, exploits, intrigues,
and fine action rich with character may not
merely be good fiction, but coming direct from
history may be like the cords which bound
Gulliver in Lilliput, each of them a tie holding
the novel to earth, and fixing it in reality. To
people for whom incident is an important thing
in the novel the historical value of <cite>The Cloister
and the Hearth</cite> lies not so much in the picture
that it gives of an age of the past, as in the
foundation that its story can claim to possess
in the life of the Father of Erasmus. In <cite>Barnaby
Rudge</cite> it is the description of Lord George
Gordon and his circle that gives the novel a
tangible connection with history; the story becomes
a story about somebody we know, a
person we have met before; history provides
the writer not merely with the world of his story,
but with actual story itself. It is regarded not
merely as a picture of things as they once were,
but as a store of narrative and of anecdote too.</p>

<p>History often gives the novelist the hint
for story, since the conditions and circumstances
of an age are full of implied story, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
are enough to set anybody tale-telling. In a
larger and more direct way, as will be shown,
it may further provide a theme for a novelist;
in the lives of people like Mary Queen of Scots,
or Richard I, and in affairs like the Gunpowder
Plot or the Jacobite risings, it may give not
exactly a story to the novelist, but a fit subject
for novel-study, something to work upon, a
problem to develop and solve; for not only on
their public side, but still more on their personal
side these things invite story; and history itself
supplies a number of incidents about them and
a general outline of broad events which set the
key for a novel and fix the lines within which
the novelist will work. But beyond all these
there is a mass of human experience, and a wide
circle of life, a whole World of People—and all
these, just the things that the novelist must most
trouble himself about—concerning which history,
as has been shown, can tell only an inadequate
story. The novelist who deals with kings
perhaps, but more often with ordinary fighters
and citizens—with courts and parliaments
sometimes, but more often with hearts and
homes, looks to history for “things that really
happened,” regarding history as a storehouse
of narrative, and finds there only episodes.
Things only come out of the darkness on brief
occasions, and many things are only hinted at,
and many threads of story are carried a short
way and then broken and dropped; History<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
bursts out here and there in a few fine flashes
of story; but very rarely is there a consecutive
flow of narrative such as would make a true,
but coherent and continuous story for a novel—a
long connected strand of story-issues only
waiting to be re-told in fiction. This history
that is narrative comes in fragments, in mere
snatches, to be incorporated in fiction. The
novelist who seeks to tell “things that really
happened” must clutch at episodes. It remains
to be seen what use he can make of them.</p>

<p>All novelists seem at times to introduce into
their works situations and happenings straight
from life, or founded upon fact; sometimes things
that have been accounted incredible or unnatural
in novels, have been defended by
authors as having been copied straight from
nature. No critic, however, would seriously
admit that the appreciation of any novel is at
all influenced by a fact like this. The literal
truth of an incident is not sufficient justification
for its inclusion in a novel, and does not even
make its presence in the work more valuable;
still less does it affect the worth of the whole
novel as a faithful representation of truth. It is
clear that the same reasoning must apply to
historical episodes incorporated into fiction. The
mere inclusion of some actual happening in a
story, the attempt to drag in a piece of history
and to patch it into a novel, is not justified by
the addition of a footnote informing the reader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
that “This incident actually took place.” The
fact may interest a reader, but it is a separate
kind of interest that it gives, and it does not
affect the total appreciation of the novel as a
complete unity. The occasional and arbitrary
use of happenings from history, the sending of
a few pistol-shots of actual episode into a piece
of work, does not alter the character of the whole,
and does not give the novel one foot in reality,
a root in actual life, any more than Dickens’s
use of events from real life brought his novels
into closer touch with reality and with truth.</p>

<p>Yet there is an important use that can be
made of historical incident in fiction, and a
more effective way of transferring anecdotes and
events from history into the novel. This time
the author does not exactly put his finger upon
some particular period in history, and work
upon that, using the conditions of the time as
the hint for story; and does not apply himself
specially to a certain wave of popular movement
or fix his attention upon particular historical
characters; these things he can never ignore,
but here they are not his first thought, and it is
not around these that his work takes shape; his
unit is rather “the thing that actually happened”;
his eye is upon the incident, and he works upon
that; and the result appears in the existence of
a peculiar type of episodical novel, which consists
of pieces of story, isolated episodes, loosely
strung together upon a thread of fiction, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
worked into one another and fused together by
fiction; and succeeding one another in such a
detached way that sometimes the unity of the
whole is very far to seek. The entire novel tends
to split up into particular knots of story, one
cluster of narrative having perhaps only the
most accidental of connections with another, and
each being in a way complete in itself.</p>

<p>This kind of novel can only come from a
history rich with the right kind of episodes. It
would seem that there are certain periods in the
world’s story, and in this case the Renaissance
would be assuredly one, and there are certain
countries and localities like the Hungary that
Jokai depicted and the Highlands of Scotland,
which are peculiarly favourable to this method
of treating history in fiction, since they appear
to throw out their history in the form of
episodes that ask to be turned into story.
When life is adventurous and full of colour
and crowded with striking incident, when,
against a romantic background, there is the
assertion of vigorous personality, resulting in
novel turns of action, and exciting combinations
of circumstance; and, above all, when these
are the kind of things that are remembered in
story and tradition and song, so that history is
a store of incidents, and a tale of exploits and
intrigues and adventures rather than a mere
narrative of social development and public
events, then the <i lang="fr">raconteur</i> must find this history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
a treasure-store of materials for a historical
novel that shall be a succession of brilliant
episodes rather than the working-out of some
great theme, some large process. The by-ways
of history, too, the dusty corners of the past,
away from the main course of broad political
movement and public event, are lit up by out-of-the-way
incidents and stories that the history
of history-books misses in its wide sweep; and
these, although rooted in fact, are things that
a story-teller would love to have invented, and
they ask to be re-told in fiction. This, then, is the
field of the novel of historical episodes. In
faults as well as in virtues many of the books of
Jokai are striking illustrations of the form; but
many novelists have adopted it with some variations;
and even a book like Merejkowski’s
<cite>Forerunner</cite>, in spite of its unity in the character
of Leonardo and in the spirit of Renaissance, is
only an example of this way of treating episodes;
it may work them into a finer whole, and centralise
the interest of the reader, and send one great
idea throbbing through each; but it can scarcely
avoid taking shape before the eyes of the reader
as a series of fine flashes of incident, each in a
way self-contained, and finding their connection
more in the fabrications of the novelist than in
the fabric of real history.</p>

<p>The first book of <cite>The Forerunner</cite> is a key to
this whole method of abstracting episodes from
history and setting them into a novel; especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
as it is one of the places where an author not only
tells his story, but at the head of his chapter
reveals his authority for it in contemporary
writings, and so allows us to see just what was
his “hint from history” and what use he made
of it. This incident of the “White She-Devil”
is a self-contained episode, one of the stray
stories that history can tell. The novelist fills
in the lines of the brief historical narrative. He
does for it what an illustrator does for any author—he
adds detail and colour and gives preciseness
and a certain elaboration to the general
outline, the vaguer description, that is given
him to work upon. More than this, fiction
somehow amplifies the whole bearings of the
event, and enlarges its significance, making it
almost symbolic; and further provides links,
that a reader can identify and put his finger
upon, slight links, just the necessary connections
that bring the affair into its place in the whole
book, and so form the excuse for its presence
in the novel at all. But the most noticeable thing
of all is not merely the episodic nature of the
material that is taken from history to be incorporated
in fiction but the episodic treatment
that is given to it. The stage is set for this
particular incident, and when it is completed
the curtain falls and we are carried away to a
totally different scene. A wealth of historical
detail is grouped around this one episode; the
episode is the thing that the whole section of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
book clusters around. When this anecdote has
been worked into a picture the author takes up
an entirely new canvas, and starts over again for
the next, raising up a fresh historic background
for it. In this way one thing succeeds another
like slides displacing one another in a lantern,
a shutter separating each; things do not run
into one another with the connectedness of a
film. If the episodic novel reaches a unity at
all, its episodes are generally related to one
another as facets of a diamond, rather than as
links in a chain; the spectator changes his
ground, his point of vision in passing from one
to another; he does not slide unconsciously from
one episode to the next.</p>

<p>In a complete and organised type of novel,
episodes usher in one another and grow out of
one another, luring the reader to a prepared
climax, each carrying the architecture of the
whole a step further, and all conspiring to produce
an event to which the whole novel is
tending. Such a novel comes to the reader as
a process unfolding itself, a theme being worked
out. In the looser type of fiction that <cite>The Cloister
and the Hearth</cite> represents, things follow one
another in a chain, and find their unity in the
fact that they all happen to the same person; so
that the novel shapes itself round the hero,
rather than into a theme. But in the episodical
novel it is not any unifying theme that is the
nucleus of the story, nor is it any particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
character, but it is the “episode.” Each chapter
is in a way a fresh inspiration and has its source
in an isolated historical fact. History supplies
not so much a run of narrative for the whole
novel, as unrelated episodes which fiction may
fasten together, but which stand alone in their
original historical setting. The whole method of
taking narrative itself straight from the history-book,
in spite of its pointedness in reproducing
definite incidents that actually happened, has
its limitations in the fragmentary nature of
history itself, or, at least, of the history that
deals with the personal human things of story-interest.
That history can only reach to episodes
as a general rule, so it is in danger of producing
something that is not a novel at all but a series
of imaginative excursions into the past, a collection
of historical “sketches.” The conflict of
loyalties in historical fiction is seen here. A
historical novel can not be made up of history
that is picked out in snatches, and of this alone.
A collection of episodes is disjointed narrative.
It may be fused into running story by the
imagination and the inventions of an author;
or it may still remain in broken narrative, yet
find a different unity in a novel that is something
more than a narration. But in either event
fiction must help out history.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The achievement of Dumas is sufficient to
show what can be done in a novel that is above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
all things a narrative. Dumas did not merely
set his novels in history and weave his stories
around men who actually lived; he took actual
situations and events, incident and action from
history; and his greatness lies in the fact that
he did not reproduce these in a broken episodic
fashion, putting each in its own frame, and on a
separate canvas, he did not merely patch them
into fictions of his own and sprinkle them in his
works, but he worked them in with his imagined
episodes into a thread of running story.</p>

<p>He was lucky in the field of his labours. The
history of the France that he described flashes
out in brilliant episodes, and is rich in characters
and situations that give the hint for more. It
is the history of the great—of kings and statesmen
and of the first in the land—but it
is at the same time an extraordinarily personal
kind of history, not a tale of dry public events.
It was set in scenes of gallantry and colour, and
was just distant enough to come to readers with
a glamour. And Dumas by the multiplicity of
the characters whose fortunes he intertwined
in his novels laid a wide field of its incident and
adventure open to himself, and brought a large
range of actual recorded facts into the scope of
his novels.</p>

<p>But it was his way of twining history and
fiction into one another, instead of tacking the
one on to the other, and of making one story
out of them, that gave him his power. He ran
the whole into one flowing narrative. A list<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
could be made of the incidents in his novels
that are taken from history but only a close
student, and a man as learned in the history of
those times as Dumas himself, can detect the
joint, the place where the actual and the invented
episodes fit into one another. History
and fiction cannot be disentangled in these
novels, and a separate rôle, a particular function
in the combined work, be assigned to each; they
grow into each other, and reinforce one another;
each somehow gives its character to the other;
so much in the novels is actual history that this
lends its character to the whole, and gives it a
root in actuality, so that the works come as a
narrative of France, a stream of national story,
a kind of history themselves.</p>

<p>The works of Dumas, therefore, do not come
as a series of shifting episodes that displace one
another. There is no stopping to set the scene
for an episode or an event. The story will run
into the Massacre of St Bartholomew and
straight out of it, and there will be no drawing
of the curtain, no break in the action, while a
stage is being arranged. Exploits and adventures
and intrigues come in quick succession,
and keep the reader on tip-toe. The result is
an effect of sheer movement. Everything seems
in motion. The novels are pure story, and
Dumas is pre-eminently a teller of stories.</p>

<p>History may be regarded as a chain of ages
that overlap, and run into each other and then
fold under—as an ocean of human life, generations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
of peoples, coming in waves through the
centuries. It may also be regarded as a thread
of narrative, a stream of story, winding through
time. Dumas more than anybody else has
succeeded in turning history into narrative like
this. His works are a thread of story running
through centuries of the history of France.</p>

<p>They are not pictures of France. Dumas’s
eye does not sweep the broad landscape of
France, does not see the whole of it. The deep
sound of the ocean of peoples does not reverberate
through his books. The great life of
France is not in them, like a sounding-board
against the noisy events of court and camp. The
ebb and flow of popular movements does not
surge through them; and only occasionally is
the swelling tide of some big heave of human
effort let in, to hint at the mass-life of France
outside the pages of the story. Dumas does not
stop to paint a horizontal scene of France as
a whole; and because of this his thread of story
keeps moving, but there are no broad landscapes
of history. There are courts and state-rooms,
hunting-fields and street-scenes; but these do
not echo the sounds from mountains and plains
and the larger France. Dumas gives a trickle
of narrative running through history; not a
surging flood. He deals with the men who in
their day were the men who mattered, the life
which, while it was being lived, was considered
to be the life that counted in France; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
deals with the region which stood out in high
light above the dark masses in the past, and
about which, therefore, history could remember
things.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The limit of the things that history can remember
must determine the range of most
historical novels, and fix their choice of subject.
It is useful to see the bearings upon this of that
slight differentiation in meaning between the
words “historic” and “historical.” A “historical”
event is anything that really happened in
history, but a “historic” one is a celebrated one—one
that would not be forgotten and that
made a noise in the world. A “historic”
character is a famous character, very often a
public man. And so history comes to mean, not
the world living out its centuries, but the stage
upon which the big things happened and were
noticed, and upon which far-reaching issues
were worked out. In all the ages of the past
there have been a few people who have moved
the world, and have cut a great figure in their
day, and behind these there has been the mass
of people who did not lead, but followed, who
did not act, but watched, who were the material
upon which the great men worked, the instrument
upon which the men in high station played.
They were spectators of the historic event, as
much as we; but only the actors in it belong to
remembered history. History then becomes, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
it were, the limelight directed upon the arena
of loud-sounding events and brilliant action,
leaving the whole theatre of spectators in darkness.
It is the platform for Cromwell and Caesar
and Napoleon and Milton; captains and kings
and discoverers and heroes feel at home upon
it; but behind it are the people who watch and
suffer and serve these Cromwells and Caesars;
they leave no memorial; and only occasionally
at moments of intense history-making, do they
break through on to the platform, and sweep
across the stage, and show that they are there.</p>

<p>This arena of great “historic” event provides
a more spacious theme for the novelist than
mere episodes abstracted from universal history
can do. Instead of wandering in the interesting
by-ways of the past, and finding surprises of
thrilling episode in out-of-the-way corners, the
novelist may boldly face the full course of
important events, and plunge into the fate and
fortunes of the great. The historical novel then
becomes an embodiment of historic things in the
sense of far-reaching, loud-sounding issues, and
it has a wider canvas, an ampler scope. Here it
is not incidents merely that are taken from history,
but a whole block of action and happening,
a whole act from the mighty drama of the ages.
History provides not merely snatches of tune
that have to be worked into some sort of connection
with one another, but a whole orchestral
theme, which the novelist re-organises and works<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
out afresh. It gives a set of issues that are
capable of novel-study, and are full of human-meaning,
and embody a problem in experience.
Only, it must be said, all this is limited, or at
least its character is determined, by the fact that
this theme must concern men who have been
in the public eye, and events that have been
enacted in the sight of the world and so have
been registered on the memory of the world. And
a novel that deals with public events and national
affairs and treats of people who are remembered
in history because of their part in the political
movements of their time, presents a problem
that is peculiar in one respect.</p>

<p>The theme of a novel is human experience
and the fate of human beings in the world. It
covers all the things that the heart has ever
touched, all the varied harmonies that it has
happened to strike as it has brushed against life.
It may concern itself with the big events that
send their echo through the ages, it may feel
the great heart that pulses in the life of a whole
continent, it may tell of movements that have
broken upon the world and changed the fate of
peoples; but its supreme interest is in a mere
man. In a sense it is true that every man is alone
in the world, and feels himself stranded amongst
“everything else.” He is, and he cannot help
being, the centre of the circle of his own horizon;
he must see his fellow-creatures as part of the
“everything else,” part of the world against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
which he stands out; and that outer world must
come to him as an experience and an adventure.
The one thing that exists for him is this experience
of the world.</p>

<p>And that is the one thing that exists in him
for the novelist. It is the aim of the novelist
to stand by the individual and feel life with
him. The waves of some political or historic
movement may touch the man and so come
within the range of the novel, but they will
not affect the man any more than his own
special, homely concerns—probably they will
only affect him through those little concerns.
It is his own hopes and ambitions and fears
as he finds himself set up against the world
of men and things, his conflict with circumstances,
his moods and his glad moments, his
risks, his falling in love, his bewilderments,
his relations with men, that make up a novel.
Some writers, like Jokai and Dumas and Stevenson,
will be specially concerned with the adventure
of his life; the things that happened, the
things he undertook, the surprises and the
thrills; these are the story-tellers whose novels
are narrations; but others, and especially the
modern novelists, look more to the experience,
and regard it as a theme to be studied as well
as a story to be related. Perhaps these are the
true historians, for they record experience, and
it is they who in the most intimate and personal
way capture life into the pages of a book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>The scope of the novel, however, is not
limited to the life and affairs of ordinary people,
average humanity. There are people who have
felt life more intensely than others, and have
reached loftier heights of experience than most.
Things may have come to them with greater
power than to the mass of people. Perhaps life
is for ever a bigger thing because they have
lived and have swept new ranges of experience,
and have happened upon new chords, fresh
harmonies of feeling, and have in some way
communicated these to the world. Then again,
there are men who, not because of any intrinsic
greatness of mind or heart, but by reason of
what we mortals can only regard as the incalculable
thing, and can only call “chance,”
have been placed in exceptional circumstances
and situations of novelty, and so have struck
upon new elements of experience, or fresh life-problems.
In the careers of such men life seems
to come out in new forms, and in unexpected
ways. If they can be captured for the novel, then
the novel can range over the finest regions of
life, and can communicate their experience to
the world, and so enlarge life for everybody
else.</p>

<p>It might seem that these, the men of exceptional
powers, and the men who find themselves
in unusual situations, are the very people whom
history does not forget; but this is only true
with one great limitation. They must be people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
whom exceptional powers or the apparent
accident of circumstances once brought into the
public eye. They must be “historic” people,
as well as “historical,” if our knowledge of
them is to be more than fragmentary. If a man
is memorable in his public life, then the world
will see to it that his private life does not go
unrecorded and unremembered; the personal
things, the experience of the man even, will
become known in so far as they are not specially
concealed and in so far as such things in the
life of an individual are communicable to others.
The novelist who can do justice to these is
widening the range of the novel, and bringing
new and intenser experience into the kingdom of
the novel, and is exploring life in its most intractable
regions. He reaches life as it has been lived,
at some of its finest points, and at some of its
most splendid or most pressing moments.
History, it has been seen, may give wing to the
novel, and may expand its range. What is
true for the life of an age or a people is here true
also of the life of individuals. Biography also
may place new fields of experience within the
scope of a novel.</p>

<p>Statesmen and kings and scientists, then, are
not shut out of the novel, but the novelist’s
interest in them is not an interest in the statesmanship,
or in the rule, or in the science but in
the whole personality of the man behind these,
and his theme is still a human heart caught into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the world and entangled in time and circumstance.
The politician, the economist, the
philosopher and the psychologist are all students
of mankind in a way, and can claim that their
studies are human studies; but they only start
with human nature, and they soon run into
theorems and formulas and lose themselves in
their own categories, and so are swept away from
contact with flesh and blood. But the novelist
does not begin with men and then leap into
abstractions. He keeps his hand on a human
pulse all the time. Political issues coming into
his work are put into their whole context in life
and experience, and instead of being abstracted
into a realm of political science they are fastened
to men and women who are “political animals,”
but are something more as well. The novelist
sees the whole of life, and he goes one further,
and one better than the scientific historian in
that men are to him (as they are to themselves)
ends in themselves, not merely servants of a
process which consumes them, not merely
means to an end and links in the chain of history.
A man may lose himself in politics or mathematics
but to the novelist it is still the man that
matters.</p>

<p>The things that are far-reaching and historic
are not to him more important than the things
that are momentary yet external. He would
give more to catch a real glimpse of Mary Queen
of Scots tapping her foot in a moment of impatience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
than to possess a logical statement of
her political position at any time. He will not
ignore the politics of some Prime Minister of
a former century, but he would love still more
to surprise him at play. A great political speech
might come within the scope of his work, but
where a historian might be tempted to sum up
the whole event in terms of politics, he would
notice too the headache that made the statesman
depressed and the heat of the building that made
him irritable, the private worries that he could
not throw off and that tormented his mind and
perverted his judgment, and the sight of a man
sitting opposite whom he detested in private life
and who wore an annoying tie. The novelist
would attempt to recapture the moment, rather
than to estimate its historic significance, and the
things which he would notice would be those
which influenced the man at the moment,
though they did not always concern the politics.</p>

<p>There was once a day when kingdoms were
a piece of family property that could be sold,
and the whole politics of a land depended on
marriages, and wars raged for years over some
intricate point in a genealogical table; in those
days public events were part of the private
concern of a king, and as surely as the succession
to a throne depended upon family inheritance,
the affairs of the kingdom depended upon personal
whims and private ambitions. There was
a time when the religious system of England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
had to be changed because a king wished to
marry a lady about his court. In the world that
Dumas described so well, personal prowess and
individual exploits determined events, and
private concerns and the prejudices and feuds
of families cut across the larger history of a
nation. There have been times when a slight
offered to a king’s mistress has been more tragic
in its results than a lost battle or a lost election;
and who knows how much the history of a reign
has been affected by an influence like that
which Buckingham had upon Charles I, or the
Duchess of Marlborough upon Queen Anne?
In all these things private life complicates even
where it does not determine public events, and
all history is full of imaginable situations like
these that invite novel-treatment. When personality
counts in public affairs, and many
things, other than purely political motives—even
things which seem trivial and accidental—determine
the conduct of a man at any time,
then the mood of a moment, the personal discomfort
or family irritation that might have
caused it, the perversities of whim and arbitrary
desire, and a hundred other things in a man may
affect history. The historical novel, not consciously
perhaps, but still demonstrably stands
for this fact. It emphasises the influence of
personal things in history, it regards man’s life
as a whole and runs his private action and his
public conduct into each other, as it ought to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
do; and it turns the whole into a study of human
nature. Even when dealing with an action that
seems purely political it will root the action in
personality, not merely in politics. Because
every public action that was ever taken can be
regarded as the private act, the personal decision
of somebody, historic events can become materials
for the novel, in spite of the fact that public
affairs and political matters are not in themselves
issues for a novel.</p>

<p>The novelist looking at a historic figure sees
personality where the scientific historian is
tempted to see only the incarnation of a policy.
He feels flesh and blood where the ordinary
history-reader complains that he is given only
abstractions. Every historic decision that comes
under his review has for him a context in the
mind of the man who made it and not simply
in the politics of the day. Behind every great
name he sees a human being, with a peculiar
experience of life; even if history does not tell
of the experience he knows it is there, he thinks
it into history and endows the man with it, and
he completes the personality in his imagination,
bringing in fiction to supply what history fails
to give. That is true resurrection, that is the
reason why historical novels are full of life and
of people, where history is often bloodless and
dead.</p>

<p>It is evident from all this that there are
particular periods and particular problems in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
history that are specially adapted to this kind
of novel-treatment. An age of riotous individualism
and of aggressive personalities is more
suited to it than one in which corporate action
determines events. An age in which war is a
game, an orgy of fun and fine fighting, is better
than one in which war is an intricate and organised
science. A king who governs by whim
is more fitting than a politician who is merely
the mouthpiece of a party, the servant of
organised action. More and more as life
increases in complexity and the world becomes
organised on impersonal lines, the historical
novel that treats of the action of personalities in
history and the interaction of private life and
public events, must find its course intricate and
hard. Ultimately personality counts to-day as
much as ever it did in history; it is still the real
power, but its influence is not direct, and immediate,
and palpable; things perhaps can be
traced back to the influence of individuals, but
it is an ultimate influence, an influence in the
last resort, and it does not show itself on the
surface of life. It is fairly true to say that the
historical novel, where it deals with politics and
public events, must seize upon those periods
of history and those phases of life in which
personality not only matters in the last resort,
but makes an immediate impression and stamps
itself directly upon the world. The mental
struggle of Charles I before he consented to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
sacrifice Strafford to his enemies, and the personal
influence which immediately contributed
to his decision are a theme for the novel; but
it would need a large admixture of fiction and
a wilful exaggeration of the interaction of
private concerns with political issues, and a
perversion of history to treat a modern change
of ministry in the same fashion.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more suited to this idea
of the historical novel than a reign like that of
Mary Queen of Scots, in which the whims of
a woman are a national concern, a direct and
immediate influence upon historic events, and
history for a time hangs upon her moods and
prejudices, and her very love-stories have a
kind of political significance.</p>

<p>Such is the sort of theme that a novelist can
take from history—one in which public affairs
appear as somebody’s private concern, and so
can be treated in a personal way. A set of historic
events or the career of some historic figure
is placed in its context in personal experience,
and is worked into a novel that may be a study
as well as a story. Somebody has said that every
individual carries within him at least one novel,
the story of his own wrestle with life. It may
be added that every historic theme, every chapter
taken out of the past contains within itself not
merely a story, but several stories, all of them
equally true, all of them representing the same
set of events as they came to the various people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
concerned and struck home in different ways—all
of them facets of the same truth.</p>

<p>What Browning did in <cite>The Ring and the Book</cite>
for the record of a “sordid police case” historical
novelists, taken all together, may be said to
do for history. Browning took his ground-work
of incident and related it nine different times,
each time from the point of view of different
people concerned, and he showed that a tale
re-told from a different standpoint and around
a fresh person is really a new tale. The whole
world of the story shifts round when a new point
of vision is adopted, the same set of events come
differently and with a different bearing. To
relate a narrative from the point of view of the
criminal in it, and then from the point of view
of the victim and then from that of the hero
is not merely to tell the same story in different
ways; it is something more striking than that,
it is to give a new tale every time. Events that
are joy to one person are grief to another, perhaps;
one man’s glad story may be somebody
else’s sad story, and if the centre of sympathy
has been changed everything in a narrative
must take a fresh shape around it. Nothing can
better illustrate the richness of history and the
many-sidedness of life than this fact; and the
historical novelist represents it in his treatment
of the past. He may make a story out of the life
of Mary Queen of Scots, and out of the same set
of facts he may make a totally different story,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
told from the point of view of Bothwell or
Elizabeth. He may enrich history by bringing
out its many-sided implications, and bringing to
light the variety and complexity of the significance
of historic happenings.</p>

<p>But it is a bold thing and a tremendous
venture, to write of the intimate thoughts and
experiences of the great, and even to guess at
the motives of their actions. Carlyle said that
only a great man could even recognise a great
man. If this is the case, many must be tempted
to ask, How can the novelist pretend to do more
than this, and to understand a great man, even
to re-create him in all his greatness? How can
he make the statesman statesmanlike, and the
queen queenly, and the prophet passionate and
soul-stirring? To do this the novelist must
within his own mind sweep the range of experience
not merely of the ordinary man, not merely
of the literary man—these things he might be
expected to do—but also of the mighty forgers
of history and the pioneers in experience; and
he who very likely cannot understand the moods
and caprices of his own landlady and who has
never pierced the mystery of personality as it
exists in her, must record the intimate thoughts,
the slightest wave of a mood that passes over the
mind like the wind over the grass, the half-conscious
motives and the deep solemn experience
in people like Mary Queen of Scots or
Oliver Cromwell or Richard I who were in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
way geniuses in living, and in particular phases
of life and experience. If the novelist does not
do this adequately, if his statesmen are not at
least statesmanlike even though not true to
facts, if his kings are not at least royal in some
way, if he does not give great men the touch of
greatness and the soul of grandeur, his characters
are merely pompous puppets, in fine dress
and on high pedestals, a piece of show, a
mocking pageantry.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most impressive way of bringing
great men into the historical novel, is not the
method which makes their lives and careers the
central theme of the book at all, demanding
intimate treatment, and close appreciation and
analysis. Many historical novels are stories of
ordinary everyday issues in the lives of people,
and deal with some personal concerns of fictitious
characters, and with the things that make up the
ordinary kind of novel; but these novels become
“historical” ones by the fact that their drama is
played out as it were in the shadow of great
public events. Some well-known, historic
character looms in the background, larger
historical issues cast their shadow at times and
perhaps at some point the narrow concerns of
the individuals whose fate makes up the story,
cross the path of these, and become interlocked
for a moment with some piece of history. In
<cite>Woodstock</cite> for example the homely problems of
a few fictitious characters, and the small vicissitudes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of a locality occupy the centre of the stage.
Their story grows out of a set of historical
relations as it existed in the days of the Protectorate,
and is a story born of the conditions of
the time in the way Scott suggested in the
Introductions to <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> and <cite>The Monastery</cite>.
The first chapter of the book brings out history
in the form of story, it is a peep at England in
the days of the Protectorate, it is a “sample,” a
kind of specimen picture of the age and the story
is implied in the conditions of the time. There
is a suggestion of the awful omnipotence of
Cromwell, and a feeling that the distant sternness
of his rule is coming near and will soon
be brought home to people, but the Protector
himself is a solemn figure in the background.
There is a kind of impressiveness in the way the
story actually crosses his path. The reader is
ushered into the presence of the great man, and
Cromwell is not treated familiarly—we do not
pry into his mind and we do not see through the
man, but everything is as though in an impressive
moment in real life we had once met the man
and felt him greater and more distant than ever.
When Charles II comes into the book a similar
thing happens; we peep at a corner of his life,
we catch one side of him, but the whole man is
not laid bare, and we know that there is a world
within him that is not revealed. In this way the
feeling that to ordinary citizens of the country
there is something impenetrable in these great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
people is maintained. Life to all of us is a chain
of private aims and personal concerns and family
or homely issues that seem to be all the world to
us as they come one after another; but far above
we can feel that larger historic issues are being
worked out oblivious of our petty concerns, and
ignoring our little lives. Only at times do our
paths cross. A war or a popular movement at
some time may touch the family and even break
up homes, sweeping away the issues and affairs
that were our little world, but even this only
accentuates our feeling that over our heads, as
it were, a great history-making is always going
on; and in the days when personalities like
Cromwell moved the world directly, and held
an immediate sway over events, such men must
have come to the minds of ordinary human
beings as distant peaks come to the traveller,
as objects of solitary impenetrable grandeur and
of awful power. In describing the world like
this, the kind of historical novel of which
<cite>Woodstock</cite> is only one of a whole variety of
examples, depicts life in a relevant and significant
fashion.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In all these ways history can be translated
into fiction and can gain something in the process;
but above them all there towers a form of
novel that is more sweeping in its treatment of
history, more ambitious in its interpretation of
life, more bold in its way of looking at the world.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
In it the novel reaches beyond itself, so that to
call it any longer a “novel” is to give it an
inadequate title. It is a prose epic; but because
it is a way by which history is turned into fiction
it cannot pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>History has been taken to mean the world
looking back upon itself, and remembering
things. But after memory comes experience and
the reflection upon experience. In our individual
lives we are not content to recall things
that happened, we do not just have memories,
and stop there; but we relate these to one another,
and see meaning in them and work them
into experiences, through which we come to see
life as unity and as purpose and as a process.
In a similar way there comes a time when
history must be something more than reminiscence,
something more than memories of this
age and that age, of one happening and another
happening, of a man here and a man there; it
must be something more even than a chain, a
succession of these; it must be a web, a unity,
woven of them all. It must be the experience
of Man on this earth, face to face with Nature,
warring with the elements, and lonely under
the sky—man at grips with Life through all
the ages. It must be a symphony, each orchestral
part doing something to express the great
idea of the whole, and each moment, each year,
each age adding a new bar to the score, and
carrying the architecture of the whole a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
further. History is not merely the story of men
and of their deeds and adventures; it is the
Epic of Man.</p>

<p>If the past is looked at in this way the individual
ceases to be the centre of focus. Men
and women and their lives become fragments
in the whole trend of things, mere ripples on
the surface of a great world-life. The surge
of historic movement, the pulse of life underneath
all lives becomes the real theme of story;
though this can only manifest itself, can only
become tangible in individual lives. The artist
who tries to capture the wind into a picture or
into words knows what this means. He may
show the leaves scattered by the wind, and the
trees bent before it, and the countryside
devastated by a hurricane; but all this is not
wind. He may paint a ship in full sail before
a breeze, or an ocean whipped to fury; but these
are not the wind; he may describe the delightful
play of the wind in your hair, or the trail of its
fingers in the grass—but that weird mysterious
thing, the wind, that comes in whispers through
the trees and sounds an organ-tone deep and
tremendous as an ocean as it sweeps over the
heather, eludes him every time. It can only be
described in its results. And the same is true
in history. The epic in historical fiction describes
the tangible and the particular, and the
concrete; but it suggests a living principle
behind these, working in these, and only manifesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
itself in them. The epic writer looking
at the life of the past sees an accumulation of
events, of details, of instances, but in them all
he divines a synthesis, and sees one throb of the
great heart of the world; and behind them all
he feels one life-principle working itself out
and carrying men with it as a tide carries the
foam or as the Spring brings the buds.</p>

<p>The power and awfulness of the wind are not
to be recognised by a glance at the weather-vane
or at the thistle-down floating through the air;
it is the cumulative effect of a hundred different
details, a hundred different things touched and
changed by the wind, that makes the wind seem
beyond escape; it is the suggestion of the broad
spaces and unlimited stretches through which
the wind can range, that must give the impression
that it is everywhere; and it is the gentleness
of its touch here, and the crash of its
irresistible rush there, that must give the idea
of its powerful yet subtle activities. The epic
that seeks to describe the heart that beats as one
behind the life of a whole people must point to
the pulse throbbing in a hundred places. It is
the overpowering effect of accumulated detail
and of all this spread over a wide canvas, that
must conspire to show some surge of a deep-sounding
tide in the lives of people, some breath
that sweeps through the life of a race; it is only
in this way that the ubiquity, the power beyond
escape, the hundred varied ways of working, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
some life-principle behind the affairs of individuals,
can be brought out. The historical
novel that is an epic, is, then, a mighty production,
a great conception minutely worked
out, a piece of architecture. It is the novel
carried to a higher power. Its hero is not a
man but a force in men. Its vision of the past
is one of titanic powers working underground.
It grapples with Destiny and dares to look the
universe in the face; and it spells out Fate and
strikes at the stars.</p>

<p>The love of wide canvases burdened with
significant detail; the large vision of the past as
one in texture with the present and as a sublime
urge of humanity rising above obstacles and
fighting its chains; and the poet’s power of
synthesis, made Victor Hugo the great master
of this epic romance, as he was its conscious
exponent. Nothing could better illustrate his
sense of the one-ness of history and the sublime
tragedy of Man’s experience in the world than
his introduction to <cite>The Toilers of the Sea</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Religion, Society and Nature; these are the three
struggles of mankind. These three struggles are at the
same time his three needs; it is necessary for him to have
a faith, hence the temple; it is necessary for him to
create, hence the city; it is necessary for him to live,
hence the plough and the ship. But these three solutions
comprise three conflicts. The mysterious difficulty of
life springs from all the three.</p>

<p>Man strives with obstacles under the form of superstition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
under the form of prejudice, and under the form
of the elements. A triple fatality weighs upon us—the
fatality of dogmas, the fatality of laws, the fatality of
matter. In <cite>Notre Dame</cite> the author has denounced the
first; in <cite lang="fr">Les Misérables</cite> he has described the second; in
this book he points out the third.</p>

<p>With these three fatalities that envelop mankind
is mingled the inward fatality—the highest fatality—the
human heart.</p>
</div>

<p>This quotation alone is sufficient to show that
the conception of the Epic of Man rests, not
upon the idea that the past is a new world for
the novelist to range in, but on a fact that is
equally true from its own point of view—the
fact of the one-ness of experience and the unity
of the past with the present. The historical
novel that is a universal epic, therefore comes to
men as an interpretation of Man’s experience
in the world. It is cosmic in conception. Also
it is the work of a man who is not merely
novelist, but poet; for though experience is all
one piece, it comes to us in fragments and we
only know it in parts, and the man who wishes
to understand it and to map out its meaning,
must in looking at past and present find a
one-ness that is not apparent in that mass of
details and people and events that confront him;
he must divine a synthesis. This seems to be
the conscious aim of Hugo, and there is a
tremendous power in his achievement that is
not to be found in the interpretation of large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
history that Merejkowski seeks to give in his
trilogy. In such works as these history as well
as the novel is carried beyond itself, and raised
to a higher power.</p>

<p>The national epic is not so broad in its sweep,
not so consciously an interpretation of universal
experience as what might be called the
Epic of Man. Here again it is not an individual
that is the hero of the story, but something
that might almost be personified, a force
working in the lives of men; only, in this case,
the stage of the drama is the Nation at some
tremendous moment in its history. The quiver
through a whole people of some breath of
national feeling is described like the stir of
the wind upon a pool; the throb of a whole
nation in some intense crisis is caught into
story. And as this surge of feeling in a people
becomes most apparent at the point at which it
meets resistance, no theme is better for this
kind of novel than that which describes in a
people the bitter sense of national liberty
thwarted, and of national aspirations refused,
the growing consciousness of repression and an
increasing desire to resist the oppressor. Where
these exist love of liberty comes as a yearning
and an aspiration and a vision; fine impulses
become conscious because they strike against
an obstacle; and they become aggressive since
they feel themselves thwarted. Nothing makes
a more powerful motive for a novel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

<p>This epic of national liberty is often itself
inspired by the national aspirations it describes.
Perhaps it would be too much to identify it with
the historical novelists of Eastern Europe,
especially since Hugo’s <cite>Ninety-Three</cite>, the hero
of which has been described as being the Revolution,
is admitted to be one of the best examples
of it; but it seems fairly true to identify it chiefly
with those countries in which the sense of
national aspirations being thwarted has recently
existed and has been an impulse to art and literature,
and a good many of the historical novels
of Eastern European writers are distinguished
by the throb of national feeling that strikes
through them. And this kind of novel is
specially calculated to produce the precise
feeling that it describes, to stir readers to the
aspirations which are its theme, and to be a force
for liberty itself. Such a result is even aimed
at by writers, so that the novel becomes in
danger of developing into a novel with a purpose.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo’s <cite>Ninety-Three</cite> is a striking
example of the epic of national freedom; and
it illustrates much of the mind of its author and
much of the character of this type of novel. It
has been said that its hero is not a particular
personage in the story, but rather the Revolution
itself. Hugo had the powerful grasp of the
character of large and complex masses of detail,
the genius for synthesis, the eagle-like sweep
of an imagination that can comprehend a multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
of things and combine them in one principle—the
very things that were needed to make a
gigantic movement of the masses the theme of
an epic. In his descriptions of the Vendée there
is a chapter on “the spirit of the place” which
shows his way of thinking; he demonstrates in
fine flights of comprehensive statement that
“the configuration of the soil decides many of
man’s actions and the earth is more his accomplice
than people believe...,” and he describes
the difference that exists between the mountain
insurgent like the Swiss, and the forest insurgent
like the Vendean: “The one almost always fights
for an ideal, the other for a prejudice. The one
soars, the other crawls. The one combats for
humanity, the other for solitude. The one
desires liberty, the other wishes isolation. The
one defends the commune, the other the parish....
The one has to deal with precipices, the other
with quagmires....” The voice of Hugo is in
all this, and whether it is true or false it shows
a mind that jumps to synthesis. There is much
more of the same kind of generalising in this
book, <cite>Ninety-Three</cite>, and often Hugo seems to be
preaching when he turns aside to throw out
some incidental flashes of it. He sees not only
the trees but the contour of the land, the character
of the forest; he grasps not merely maddening
events and a confusion of men bustling with
action, but divines the whole curve of the mass-movement.
He can speak of “the immense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
profile of the French Revolution,” thrown across
“the deep and distant Heavens, against a background
at once serene and tragic.” It is significant
enough that he can think of the Revolution
as something like that.</p>

<p>Those chapters of the novel, however, which
describe “the streets of Paris at that time,” the
conversation between Robespierre, Danton, and
Marat, and the Convention itself, and the
Vendée, are weighed down by an accumulation
of significant and often grim detail, a piling-up
of incident upon incident, and example upon
example. In these the Revolution is not only
shown as having a character, a profile, but also
is revealed as being a living thing, a vivid many-sided
creature, betraying its character in a host
of unexpected ways, flashing out in a thousand
fresh surprises, in a multiplicity of manifestations.
It is shown to be like Nature that sends
out a crocus here, a daffodil there, green buds
and almond blossom somewhere else, and the
song of the birds everywhere, all of them saying
in a number of ways that the Spring has come.
It comes to us like the wind that moves the
grass and the weather-vane, the smoke and the
sailing-ship and the creaking door—and in a
score of different voices makes itself heard to
men. The mass of detail reveals the Revolution
as an intricate thing, a complex tangle perhaps,
but most of all as a vivid many-sided life, a unity
in a hundred variations, a principle that is for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
ever finding a host of new ways of expressing
itself.</p>

<p>Hugo described the Convention by heaping
up a store of details, and burdening his whole
chapter with a weight of concrete instances. Each
of these was significant in itself and showed the
Revolution in some way leaping out and leaving
its mark in history; and the cumulative effect
of the whole revealed the bewildering variety
of the processes and the life of the Revolution.
Before he closed the description, however, he
wrote a few paragraphs that reveal the key-idea
of the whole. He had been speaking of the
men of the Convention, he had already turned
aside to tell us that the Convention “had a
life,” and he had piled up a host of instances of
how that life had broken through into incident
and action, and had mentioned the
turbulent spirits that made up the life of the
Assembly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Spirits which were a prey of the wind (he continued).
But this was a miracle-working wind. To be a member
of the Convention was to be a wave of the ocean. This
was true even of the greatest there. The force of impulsion
came from on high. There was a Will in the
Convention which was that of all and yet not that of any
one person. This Will was an Idea, indomitable and
immeasurable, which swept from the summit of Heaven
into darkness below. We call this Revolution. When
that idea passed it beat down one, and raised up another;
it scattered this man into foam and dashed that one upon
the reefs. This Idea knew whither it was going, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
drove the whirlpool before it. To ascribe the Revolution
to men is to ascribe the tide to the waves....</p>

<p>The Revolution is a form of the eternal phenomenon
which presses upon us from every quarter, and which we
call Necessity.</p>
</div>

<p>This, then, is the idea that gives a synthesis
to all the mass of details, this is the wind which
reveals itself in the multitude of spirits which it
moves. In this kind of thinking Hugo is trying
to interpret man’s experience upon earth. His
story is more than a narration. He has seen the
epic in history.</p>

<p>Above all this, however, the French Revolution
comes to us as the hero of the novel
because of the remarkable way in which it
is personified in the man Cimourdain, who
seems to have caught something of its life into
himself. “He saw the Revolution loom into
life,” says Hugo; “He was not a man to be
afraid of that giant; far from it. This sudden
growth in everything had revivified himself....
From year to year he saw events gain in grandeur
and he increased with them.” The year 1793
represents above all things the time when the
“something” inexorable in the very idea of the
Revolution became most marked, most pressing,
and Hugo has made this the prominent feature
in his characterisation of the year. The book is
full of cruel alternatives, and of Councils and men
torn between unreserved devotion to the Ideal,
the Revolution, and generous impulses towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
men, humanitarian feelings. Cimourdain is the
personification of this struggle between utter
selfness service to a cause and a heart’s loyalty
to a friend. Hugo’s whole characterisation of
him hangs upon this feature of his character,
this cleavage in his soul. The theme of the
whole novel is the life and conduct of men like
Lantenac and Gauvain as they are brought face
to face with the inexorable demands of their
Cause. Lantenac, however, is a Vendean; and
Gauvain at the supreme trial sacrifices the Cause
to his feelings of generosity. Cimourdain alone
is immovable, and is devoted to his Ideal to the
point of being inhuman. He personifies the
Revolution, therefore. He is more than a man,
he is greater than a hero of a novel, he is the
central figure of an epic.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="in0">Molly was a handsome fool.... She lacked the historic
sense; and if she thought of Rome at all, supposed it
a collocation of warehouses, jetties, and a church or
two—an unfamiliar Wapping upon a river with a long
name.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">Maurice Hewlett’s heroine had known only
Wapping and Wapping was her world. She
could not think of Rome as being, so to speak,
the blossom of another sort of tree—a place
where the very sky looked different; but she
must take Wapping as the pattern of things.
Her untravelled mind could not see that Life
as it strikes through the Earth, crystallising into
towns and cities and breaking out in buildings
and fashions and thoughts, is one thing here
and another thing there, and ever finds fresh
forms for its expression like an artist in his
moods. Molly could not dream that all history—and,
behind history, geography—had conspired
to make Rome a different picture, a
different mood, from the Wapping she had
known. She “lacked the historic sense.” It was
not that the warehouses of Rome might be
different from those of Wapping, or its churches
bigger, or all these set out in an unfamiliar way;
it would have been wrong if it had been possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
to think of Rome as an unfamiliar Wapping,
without warehouses, jetties and churches, all.
The truth was that Rome was one poem, and
Wapping was another poem; and each was the
clothing of a Life. Each was a personality; in
a way, a world in itself. Each had that sort of
one-ness and identity which gave it an “atmosphere”
of its own.</p>

<p>For a mind that is moulded to a locality the
historical novel can come as travel and as an
opening of the windows of the world. It is not
a history-lesson, a book that sits to facts, a
record of things as they actually happened; or
rather, it may be all this and it has an added
power if it is, but its appeal and purpose are not
here. When a reader comes to the historical
novel he is not, or ought not to be, ignorant
of the fact that it is a form of fiction that he is
reading, and that history in it is mixed with
inventions in a proportion which he cannot be
expected to estimate with any precision. The
novel does not replace the history-book; it is a
splendid thing if it drives us to the history-book,
if it provides us with something—some sort of
texture—in which the facts of the history-book,
when we come to them, can find a context and
a lively significance and a field that gives them
play. The real justification of the novel as a
way of dealing with the past, is that it brings
home to readers the fact that there is such a
thing as a world of the past to tell tales about—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
arena of vivid and momentous life, in which,
men and women were flesh and blood, their
sorrows and hopes and adventures real as ours,
and their moment as precious as our moment.
The power of the novel is that it can give to
people the feeling for history, the consciousness
that this world is an old world that can tell many
stories of lost years, the sense that the present
age is the last of a trail of centuries. It makes
history a kind of extension of our personal
experience, and not merely an addition to the
sum of our knowledge.</p>

<p>For the novelist therefore it is more important
to depict the past as a world different from our
own, and to show something of its character and
colouring than to map out a particular path in
that world and to track down a particular course
of public events. It is more important for him
to breathe the spirit of a bygone age, and make
his book the stuff of its mind, and recapture its
turns of thought, its fund of feeling, and all its
waywardnesses than to chronicle events with
precision and keep tight to big political happenings.
The supreme thing for him is to catch
the age as a synthesis, to reproduce its way of
looking at the world, its acceptance of life, and
the peculiar quality of its experience, rather than
to relate things that actually happened. Looking
to some distant time he does not, so to speak,
see “notes,” and relations of notes, but catches
a “tune”; he figures it, not as a heap of facts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
and happenings but as the World-life in one of
its moods. He enumerates, describes, comments,
perhaps; but the real secret of his art is
that in doing all these things he disengages a
subtle influence—does it as if by stealth—he
breathes a thing that quickens and that is as
spirit to the body; so that while he is describing
or reflecting or narrating the age itself seems to
conspire with him, and presents itself in its
“atmosphere.”</p>

<p>Atmosphere eludes the analyst. It might
almost be said that to define it would be to
explain it away. Probably the novelist most
successful in producing it would be unable to
describe how the thing is done. It is part of its
essence that you should not see its working; if
you detect scaffolding anywhere there is disillusionment
and you are back to earth again;
if you discover the spell it revenges itself upon
you and sulks, and though you may admire the
cleverness of it, it is magic no longer for you.
It likes you to forget it, and captures you unawares,
and then you will recall how it was
atmosphere that stole you; but hunt it, and you
thwart it, and put yourself out of tune for it.
You may remember that some book was a
world, and that world showed itself in its
atmosphere, and the atmosphere was everywhere,
but you cannot put your finger upon a
printed page and say “it is here.” In this it is
worthy of its name, it defies immediate apprehension.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
It will not meet you in the face. It is
a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Various ages of history have their atmosphere—the
Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the
eighteenth century; but atmosphere does not
move in step with history, does not belong
merely to epochs. Countries and localities have
it—like the Highlands of Scotland, or Hungary;
and the atmosphere of Puritan London is not
that of the contemporary Paris. The peasantry
of Scott and the racy story-world in which
Dumas was himself, come to us with their
atmosphere; and a monastery or a diplomatic
circle or the court of some king may carry
theirs in a similar way. These are definite
areas that cover the lives of men, and they have
not merely characteristics but characters of their
own. They are not simply modifications of one
another any more than Rome is Wapping with
a difference. Each is a fresh canvas and in
calling them to mind we mix our colours and
our emotions differently every time; each leaps
in turn as a whole into our minds, so that we
think of them as being not merely varied
groupings of notes, but different tunes altogether.
Each, like a personality, has its particular
way of looking at the world and its
peculiar attitude to things, and this comes out
in a particular twist of mind in men, peculiar
tricks of thought and prejudices and shades of
feeling. The peasantry of Scotland must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
a different sort of jokes, a different range of
allusions from the courtiers of Louis XIV.
Various of these regions of life and circles of
activity must have their special phraseology,
even a kind of dialect of their own. Atmosphere
belongs to a region that is a life, an identity,
a world in itself, and a peculiar synthesis; and
he who has the atmosphere must have found—or
rather felt—the synthesis.</p>

<p>These various areas of life—ages of history,
localities and circles of activity—may be viewed
as being worlds in themselves and as having
a life of their own; but that life only shows itself
in its results, as for instance, in the prejudices
and turns of thought and habits and peculiarities
of speech of the members who make up the
world. And just as a child learning to read at
first spells out only letters, and consciously
combines them into words and only gradually
learns to see words as a whole and take them in
at a glance—just as a learner in music at first
only sees notes and has to use some effort in
order to combine them into a chord, and only
later comes to grasp a chord at sight—so the
student of history at first sees only these isolated
details and pieces of fact, and must gradually
come to the point at which his mind can jump
to a synthesis and see the one life that is the
source of a variety of facts. The novelist
consciously reproducing facts from history,
copying its handwriting letter by letter, advancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
by accumulation, and straining for a
faithful presentation of details in the life of a
people, can scarcely avoid betraying the mechanism
with which he works; but the writer
who has caught the principle that lies behind all
these facts, and sees not merely men and actions
and sayings, but a life underneath all these, has
caught history at its source; he can throw down
his scaffolding. Step by step he has followed
facts and weighed his evidence and hung upon
details, until there has flashed in upon him the
something that gives light and meaning to them
all, and changes them into a vision. The age
of history is no longer to him a sum of information,
but a world that has been won and appropriated.
More facts and details that he may
amass find their setting and significance, find
a context in that world; they may also check,
or change, or amplify his acceptance and appreciation
of it; but to him, that age of history is
a world in his mind, like a childhood’s scene
half-remembered, and he may withdraw to it at
will, retreading it in his thinking—crossing and
recrossing, and playing upon it in his imagination,
all the time recasting it in the process.</p>

<p>Behind a thousand sunsets there lies a world
where men were full of the hunt and the anxious
harvest-times, and slept with their swords near
at hand. To them the Atlantic Ocean was a
thing to raise terror, a place for strange storytelling;
the demons were not yet driven from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the woods; and earth was a precarious place in
which the elemental forces seemed inexorable.
It was a world of wild mythologies, and of
simple things half-understood. It comes to us—we
“remember” it—in fragments like this;
and we try to piece it together again. The
centuries have tiptoed and gone, and the things
that people have been afraid of, the things that
have raised a thrill, the things men have talked
and joked and told easy lies about, have not
always remained the same. Their logic has
been different from our logic, as a schoolboy’s
is different from a priest’s. The things which
in their thinking they were always referring to,
mirrored the world they knew. The ideas that
were handy to their minds, the words that came
soonest to their lips, the turn that was easiest to
their talk, their whole fund of metaphors and
expressions, betrayed their preoccupations and
lit up the background of their lives. Perhaps
the Sunday church-bell sounded differently to
their ears and reached a hidden corner in their
minds. Perhaps they had not learned to think
of the stars as loveliness. For them there could
be no evening silhouettes of chimney-pots and
telegraph-wires against the glaring moon, no
dream of long white roads that should shake
with hurried, humming traffic—the pictures
they felt at home with were not the same as ours.
And just as, in a land where earthquakes are to
be expected, the fact must give a twist to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
art of building, the thoughts of architects, so,
in those distant ages, the world that people knew,
the things they felt at home with, a hundred
significant details, moulded the forms of their
thoughts, and conditioned the terms of their
thinking, and made the maps of their minds.
It is by entering into this fact that the novelist
can do more than simply copy some recorded
details of their world, and can recapture something
of their life. In so far as he succeeds at
all it is because the things which conditioned
their thinking, he accepts for himself. He does
not analyse them from the outside, but submits
and surrenders to them, makes them in fact
his own. Telling a tale of some far-off world, he
will not speak of the stars with the love of the
poet; he will remember that the astrologers had
made them a dread relentless destiny, so that
this would be an alien fact. He will explore
things of this kind, and take them into his
thinking, and make them part of his kingdom;
for it is a surprise of facts such as this—which
show the age true to itself in an unexpected way—and
it is the cumulative effect of a host of
them, that powerfully make for atmosphere.</p>

<p>And just as he enters into the things that
conditioned the thinking of these men of former
days, the novelist in a larger way fits life to the
things which conditioned their experience, and
moves within the framework of the age. It is
the same human nature all the time, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
is describing, but it comes in different disguises,
and is always finding fresh symbols for itself,
fresh forms for its expression. The same essential
fact, the same inner experience, takes
different turns in its unfolding. The boy who
runs away to escape the drudgery near at hand
may be the same in every century; but to-day
it will be the dullness of school-routine that
brings unrest and the cinema that brings incitement;
while in some bygone age it would be
the cruelty of apprentice-life that became unbearable,
and tales of high adventure on the
Spanish Main that made the world inviting.
This would lead to a different wayfaring. It is
a fresh story altogether. Love may be ever the
same but it will not blossom out into the identical
facts, it will not raise the same issues, it will not
lure to the same adventures, altogether it will
not unfold its story in the same way, in various
worlds of convention. The novelist who knows
the experience must weave it to the pattern and
run it into the mould of the century with which
he is dealing, he must fit it to the machinery of
life as it then was, he must translate it into the
terms of the age. Present experience, in so far as
it is eternal experience, can be referred back to a
different world, where even to the farthest detail
of its working it will run into different forms;
and the facility, the inevitability with which this
is done, so that you do not find a modern love-story
transplanted into alien soil, patched into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
an old tapestry, set in a mere background of
mediaeval staging and dress, but the whole
theme overhauled with insistent reference to
the conditioning features of the age, by a mind
that has not wearied of playing upon the implications
of these things—is one of the things
which make the age as reproduced in the novel
come to us with conviction, and with atmosphere.
Perhaps the lack of this constant way of running
back to the past in thinking till everything has
been remoulded is what makes <cite>The Cloister and
the Hearth</cite> fail in atmosphere, and seem like a
story of modern convention merely clothed in
an old-world dress and staged in mediaeval
setting, without coming as a live blossoming of
mediaeval life.</p>

<p>It is recalled in Henry James’s <cite>Notes on
Novelists</cite> how Robert Louis Stevenson made
Edinburgh his “own.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And this (we are told) even in spite of continual
absence—in virtue of a constant imaginative reference
and an intense intellectual possession.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">In a similar way if at all—the historian wins
over for himself, and comes to possess an age
of the past; but whereas Stevenson in his
absence could constantly shoot back in his mind
to a distant, remembered Edinburgh, in the
case of the historian it is in a peculiar sense an
irrecoverable, and so to speak, only half-remembered
world that is “referred” to, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
man cannot go direct to the original to confirm
the mental picture he retains. He can never
know the past just as Stevenson knew the city
he had actually trodden, and there is more of
himself, more of the personal element, in his
appropriation of it—how much, he cannot tell,
because he can never go behind his vision of the
past to compare it with the reality. We who
may hold some place as Stevenson did Edinburgh,
and perhaps remember it as a distant
thing we knew in the old days, and retread it in
our imagination and refer to it in our thinking—we
can return to the spot itself to verify the
impression it has left in our minds and see if
our picture is true; and returning we may be
shocked to find how Memory has played us
false, how the Edinburgh that was in our
thoughts is out of touch with the real thing.
Working with an equally imperfect “Memory”
the historian cannot do this, cannot put back
the clock to a distant age to see if the “world”
he has created out of it in his mind has parted
from reality. And yet, given that “world” of the
past as he holds it, it is still true that he makes
it peculiarly his own, in that he constantly
traverses it in his imagination, it is as a magnet
to his mind, he carries present things back into
it and is for ever making calls upon it, till it
becomes a part of his thinking. It was because
Scott had worked like this upon the history that
he knew so well, and because he had entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
into the past in this special way and made it a
country of his mind, that Hutton could write
of him that “He had something like a personal
experience of several centuries.”</p>

<p>The man who does this and can feel at home
in a certain “world” of history, who saturates
himself with the spirit of an age and breathes its
very air, and having touched the life of a time
has turned it over in his mind and has played
upon it and pondered over it in his thinking—will
learn to catch unawares the turns of thought
that were current then, will reproduce in a
spontaneous way the habits and modes of life
of the past—the things he would otherwise have
had to copy with servility—and will enter without
effort into the very tricks of speech of some
former day. Instead of transplanting facts and
specific details direct from the history-book into
the story-book, he will find expression for the
life which he has made his own, letting it
blossom out into its own appropriate “facts,” its
inevitable manifestations. Atmosphere, though
not merely the result of spontaneity, any more
than the electricity is the result of the wire,
demands this as its necessary concomitant, as
electricity demands the completed circuit. Perhaps
it may be said that atmosphere is the result
of a conspiracy of details that come in an effortless
way from a mind that has entered into
the experience and made appropriation of the
“world,” of some age in history. It belongs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
the past age in some sense; but it cannot be
separated from the personality of the novelist
himself. Charles Lamb steeped his mind in old
writers until some of their quaintness and charm
passed into himself and came out in his prose
style; and in this way he caught history somehow
into his personality. Similarly the historical
novelist does not merely acquire information
about the past, but absorbs it into his mind.
Atmosphere comes out in his books as the overflow
of a personality that has made a peculiar
appropriation of history. It comes as part of the
man himself.</p>

<p>This explains why Hewlett is at home in a
peculiarly romantic and coloured world like
that of Renaissance Italy, and Dumas is really
himself when his books are in an atmosphere of
court intrigue and racy adventure, and Scott
is a king in his kingdom when he is in the
peasant-world of Scotland or when he is concerned
with those Covenanting days of which
he wrote “I am complete master of the whole
history of these strange times.” These writers
breathe in their novels a life that they have made
their own, and that has become part of themselves.
It is not a particular period of history
but rather a particular phase of life, a certain
type of experience, a definite sort of “world”
that these writers have come to possess and can
so describe with all appropriate atmosphere;
and it is not necessarily when they change their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
period of history but when they move into a
different world and concern themselves with a
type of life and experience which they have not
made their own by any “constant imaginative
reference” that they find themselves out of
their element. If they take up a fresh corner of
life like this for their stories, they are unable
to escape from the atmosphere that is really
theirs, they cannot shake off the things that
belong to the world which is their true world
and which has become a part of their thinking;
and either they give us no atmosphere at all,
or (which is at bottom the same thing) they
trail with them into this fresh world an atmosphere
which is here alien and inappropriate but
which has become part and parcel of themselves.</p>

<p>Moreover, when Hewlett in <cite>King Richard
Yea-and-Nay</cite> and Hugo in <cite>Notre Dame de Paris</cite>
give us the Middle Ages, although they both
achieve a certain atmosphere, it is a different
atmosphere in each case. Just as Hugo in
<cite>Ninety-Three</cite> reconstructed the French Revolution
with his eye upon the conflict between the
inexorable demands of the Cause at a moment of
crisis and the generous, humane impulses of men
who served the cause, he has restored the
Middle Ages in <cite>Notre Dame</cite> with his eye upon
the Cathedral that is the centre of his story.
Wherever he looks he sees a gargoyle; his mind
seizes upon the grotesque; and his mediaeval
world shapes itself around this central fact.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
Hewlett reproduces the Middle Ages as they
exist rather in the mind of the poet. Whether
he tells of King Richard, or depicts Renaissance
times, or relates the story of Mary Queen of
Scots, there is always something in his atmosphere
that is Hewlett himself, there is a melody
in his style, a peculiarity in the very order of his
words, that breathes a sort of romance; he gives
us the past seen through the coloured windows
of his mind. Hugo stands alone as a man who,
strikingly aware of the power of accumulated
detail, produces atmosphere in a conscious way,
knowing what he is doing and how he does it;
but he reveals the bent of his mind in the
particular appropriation which he makes of the
Middle Ages, and in the type of significant fact
which he fastens upon. In Hewlett in a more
subjective way, there is the mysterious communication
of personality. But in every case
there is a certain element in atmosphere that is
communicated to the past and is imputed to a
bygone age by the mind of the man who resurrects
the past. His own experience of the
past as he has learned to live in it, his own
emotions as he looks at some distant century,
are transferred to that century. The novelist
does not merely reproduce the past any more
than an artist merely copies nature; he loads it
with something of himself, he cannot describe
it without betraying his way of looking at it;
and all this is true also of any historian who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
achieves real resurrection and atmosphere. At
its extreme it means a kind of “pathetic fallacy”
with a scene in history instead of a scene in
nature, shaping itself to the moods and the mind
of a man. It is what Carlyle does when he turns
to historic men and movements. It is what
Turner did when he painted “Ulysses deriding
Polyphemus” amid all the glow and colour of
legend. It is what the grown-up writer does who
gives us children’s tales and childhood scenes
that seem so charmingly child-like to other
grown-ups. It is what all of us do with far-off,
remembered things.</p>

<p>And because of all this there is something in
the make-up of a historical novelist’s mind,
something in his temperament and outlook
which finds its peculiar home in various corners
of the world of the past. There is something in
various ages of history, various phases of life
and experience, various types of thinking, to
which his mind naturally turns, and in which he
finds his element. There is something in his
own life which answers to its counterpart in
history, and finds its own world there. A man
like Jokai can catch the atmosphere of some
revolutionary movement—as in <cite>The Green Book</cite>—and
can thrill a novel with the feelings and
the subtle workings of a secret yearning for
freedom, because in real life he lived this, and
finding it in history found something of himself.
Carlyle’s Cromwell, Carlyle’s Mirabeau have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
passed through Carlyle’s mind and come out
crooked; but there was in their way of thinking
and in their wrestles with life a thing which
Carlyle had in common with them, and which
drew his thoughts to them and made their
experience a thing he could enter into. That was
why he could assimilate them so powerfully to
himself. That also was why his interpretations
of them were contributions to history, and not
mere wild distortions.</p>

<p>And so, for the resurrection of the past and
the true re-telling of the life of the past the
novelist’s peculiar art has something to contribute.
The virtue and power of the novelist’s
depiction of men, is not that he observes perpetually
and arranges data, but that he enters
into the experiences of others, he runs his life
into the mould of their lives, he puts himself
under the conditioning circumstances of their
thinking. He can feel with people unlike himself
and look at the world with their eyes and
grapple with the issues of life that meet them,
because he can put himself in their place, that
is to say, because his experience is not entirely
and merely his own. It is precisely because
personality is not cut off from personality, and
a man is not entirely locked up within himself,
with the depths of him completely hidden away
from everybody else, that the novelist can so
to speak transpose himself and catch life into
a person other than himself. It is precisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
because in the last resort a distant age of history
is not its own secret, curled up in its own world,
and cut off from the present day—because the
men of the past had red blood in their veins and
were a phase of a life that is universal and eternal—that
History can recapture something of their
struggles and yearnings and their particular
experiences. The history of history-books gives
us a glimpse of the men of the past, a chart of
the facts that governed their world, an idea of
the conditioning circumstances of their lives;
but it withholds the closest human things, the
touches of direct experience. And because life
is all one, and essential experience ultimately the
same, these are the very things which the novelist,
better than most people, can read back into the
past. These provide the peculiar place, the
legitimate rôle for historical fiction. The novelist
will inevitably colour his pictures of an age with
something of himself, for the pictures are born
of his thinking; but in so far as he does all this
in tune, surprising us with facts that flash, and
that light up the age in unexpected ways, and lure
us into a “world,” he will have atmosphere;
and in so far as he remains true to the chart
which history gives him he will have the true
historical atmosphere.</p>

<p>The historical novel, then, is one of many
ways of treating the past and of wresting from
it its secret. Given the facts of Nature a scientist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
will make one use of them, and will do a certain
kind of thinking around them; but the artist or
the poet will turn a different light upon them
and meet them in a different way. Given the
facts of the past, the historian shapes them in
one way, squeezes something out of them, hunts
out a set of implications in them; the novelist
uses them to a different purpose, organises them
differently, and turns them over in his thinking
with a different kind of logic. Given an event
the historian will seek to estimate its ultimate
significance and to trace out its influence, the
novelist will seek merely to recapture the fleeting
moment, to see the thing happening, to turn
it into a picture or a “situation.” With a set
of facts about the social conditions of England
in the Middle Ages the historian will seek to
make a generalisation, to find a formula; the
novelist will seek a different sort of synthesis
and will try to reconstruct a world, to particularise,
to catch a glimpse of human nature.
Each will notice different things and follow
different clues; for to the historian the past is
the whole process of development that leads up
to the present; to the novelist it is a strange world
to tell tales about.</p>
